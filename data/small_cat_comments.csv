In 2012 an American study found the 70% of the woman that had a positive Downs syndrome diagnosis choose (selected) to have an abortion. That's pure eugenics whether you like it or not. Just own in for what it is. Why do you need to hide behind semantics? Is it it so important to be the good guy? And how is it less worse to terminate (kill) a fully healthy fetus?

* The image lacked sufficient explanation/discussion to stand alone - Example: Instead of submitting box art of an old game with a title like ""Who wants to see this on the Switch?"", make a discussion post explaining what you would like to see from a game in that series, what inspirations you would like it to take, etc.

* The image was poorly made (Microsoft Paint, etc)

2269014,video_games,"I think the opener is more fluid than that though -- it comes down to knowing the fights with experience and knowing when you should pre-SK (if that means you'd get an extra Stormkeeper squeezed in to the fight length) and also taking advantage of mechanics for Ascendance windows, like holding off on Ascendance until after you've finished the first rings set and have gotten the speed buff on Elis and have a 15 second window to turret her.

For example, on Krosus, I always run my opener like this:  
* -4s - Stormkeeper  
* -3s - Fire Ele  
* -2s - Pot  
* -1s - Elemental Blast  
* -0s - Flame Shock  
* 2x LvB  
* LBx3, using any Surge procs between and re-applying FlS with Elemental Focus  
* Elemental Blast  
* Ascendance + Racials, spamming Lava Burst and not Earth Shocking, only stopping the Meatballs to re-EB  

That way I also get to see if I'm going to get the first orb (which seems to happen every time I don't SK first and Ascendance on pull). But for fights like Gul'dan and Elisande, where there are good opportunities within the first 20-30 seconds to hit 3+ targets with SK-infused CLs, I hold off. 

That's also the opener that SimC gives me almost always regardless of fight lengths that I set. Just one perspective. 

Also, you didn't cast Chain Lightning once during Elisande. I'm not sure if your group wasn't stacking the boss on the adds when they were spawning, but unless you have POTM procs you should always CL on two+ targets (I'm usually bad and CL even with 2). That should be a nice DPS increase for you there alone -- at least 50k, since the DPS parsing above you all have multi-cleave damage as their highest sources of damage I'm assuming they were stacked and you were just ST'ing.

Try to take advantage of CL as often as possible -- it generates more Maelstrom than LB if it's hitting at least 2 targets and even more with the trait that increases the Overload chance, so it's always a better bet to CL to get to that 92+ Earth Shock quicker.

And yeah, the other thing is just to make sure you have a simple WA that lets you know when you're at or about to be Maelstrom capped. Make it yell at you. Since you are having a bit of trouble with Maelstrom management already, I would recommend running Lightning Rod or Ascendance build for the majority of NH fights, since Icefury is much more reliant on you being able to predict your Maelstrom 1-2 casts in advance for maximizing DPS. Once you're familiar with the fights and the basic rotation, that's when I'd say fuck around with Icefury on the dummies."

281261,video_games,"Got me there.

Got anything to counter my arguments regarding the 3DS being on the outs, i.e. there's nothing major coming out which Nintendo has announced?

Nintendo's official position is that the 3DS is still alive and well, but the only upcoming games it has announced are Mario Sports Allstars and a Fire Emblem spin-off. The six others (of eight total) are [fairly minor](https://www.nintendo.com/games/coming-soon/#nintendo-3ds), and half of the games announced are coming out in the next three months.

Nintendo is usually pretty good about keeping a stream of upcoming games available for active consoles, but the foreseeable future is all Switch titles. If the Nintendo 3DS lineup was going to be continuing as a separate thing, Nintendo would be continuing to release 3DS games, as whatever follows the 3DS in that line would likely be backwards compatible, the same way the 3DS was DS-compatible and the same way the DS was GBA-compatible.

We're not seeing that, because Nintendo's future in the handheld space is not going to be on the 3DS. We're even seeing plenty of traditionally-3DS/DS lineup titles heading to the Switch, such as Dragon Quest X/XI, Shin Megami Tensei, and Fire Emblem.

You can go by the official statement all you want, but the writing is clearly on the wall, here."

But that's the other thing, Nintendo's 3rd party support has continued to deteriorate. First title Ubisoft mentioned? *Just Dance 2017*. Even ZombiU, which actually was in a bundle, saw just 600k copies sold. If it wasn't for the fact that it's also being seen as a 3DS replacement, I would say that the Switch will sell 9M units, with some of its best selling software selling 2-4M each. But since it is, and it means that there will likely be a Pokemon release, those numbers might be higher. I also predict more shovelware but not necessarily good TP support.

The internet has no centre, it's literally as decentralized as it gets.  ICANN is about the only thing that is centralized, but that's just for domain names. 

A private website, hosted on an in house dedicated server, that just uses an IP address as it's place on the web, is just about as dark as any onion site 

Regulating the internet is about as flawed a plan as it gets. 

Sure, North Korea does it to an extreme, but the people never really had it in the first place. A couple basic sites dedicated to in-NK happenings and that's it. Attempting to access anything outside of their intranet is blocked and throttled hardcore. There is one little fragile line out of NK, and that's very much so the government can watch what the outside world is saying about them. Some people have learned to tap into that however, as dangerous a thing that is to do.

China really goes out of its way to deal with its humongous firewall, including blocking all things google and instead building and insisting all things Baidu (for the unaware, Baidu is China's google, they too have things like Baidu Maps and Baidu Webmaster Tools, reCaptchas, etc), but the people keep finding ways around it if they want to explore beyond the Chinese copycat sites that only offer explicitly Chinese content 

The point is, even in extreme cases like North Korea, people will find a way. Most just accept it, but you can bet that some technology savvy rebellious rapscallions have drummed up some of their own intranets. That's only an assumption though, I can't base that on anything. 

But trying to NK an established hyperconnected country like the USA? Basically impossible at this point. "

1107693,video_games,"&gt;there were broken dumb heroes when I played.

The thing is, there may be 'broken dumb heroes', but there is always a 'counter' to those broken dumb heroes through itemisation or though another hero - In league when you have a 'Broken dumb champion' like Camille, there isn't really much room to play around her as she has much more damage, utility, mobility and flexability in fights than anyone else.

&gt; competitive champion pools were pretty much the same every game, with contested op picks, just like league.

There may be contested Op picks - But no champion in DoTA is just a better version of another hero - In LoL right now you have essentially a 5 champion ADC pool in pro play based on teirs Varus=Jhin &gt; Ashe &gt; MF &gt; Sivir.

You also don't have to pick an 'ADC' in dota to not lose every teamfight post-30 minutes or be able to siege turrets Teamcomps are much more variable as there is more than one way to play the game of DoTA - League these days is so set around playing around baron and dragons that any strategy not based around teamfighting instantly loses you the game - Splitpushing in League is dead in competitive play.

Dota also ends most of it's TI's (Worlds equivalents) with over 100+ Unique picks, where League is floating around 60+ unique picks. DoTA has less characters to choose from also, and actually plays less games in this tournament AFAIK.

&gt;DotA has more international tournaments, but Riot is the leader in E-sports support

Riot is the leader because their game is just more popular - I prefer more international tournaments like CS:GO and DoTA2 and think a meaningless spring and a semi-meaningless summer split are boring to watch outside of the playoffs. 

&gt;Also fuck turn rates.

Turn rates are in the game to balance ranged and melee champions mobility - They may feel clunky to someone who hasn't played much of the game at all, but are an incredibly important balancing anchor of the game itself. 
Every time I hear 'fuck turning rates' I think of a how DoTA would be without them, and it makes me think of leagues simplicity of ranged champions virtually always having an advantage over melee almost always. - Lack of turnrates is why there are no melee hard-carries in League.

2014481,science_and_technology,"So, I'm not sure if anyone here remembers. But there is some history behind your exact question.

Back in the day /r/technology used to be a default. Not anymore. Why? Well back in the day when Tesla was first emerging, /r/technology was getting posts relating a lot more to tech and politics. They were important, they fit in /r/technology, but it seemed to take over the sub.

The mods at the time started to get really annoyed regarding so many posts about Tesla and politics at the time. There was some shit going down which had redditors up in arms. I think it had something to do with Republicans attacking Obama over the government loans he gave out to solar companies. 

So there was this huge debate going on in America and reddit wanted to showcase Tesla and its accomplishments as a reason to support the loans Obama gave.

Anyway, the mods made a stupid mistake of censoring Tesla entirely. So automod basically deleted every single mention of Tesla, its cars, its owner, its politics, etc.

Finally a redditor discovered this and posted about it. It was a huge controversy and eventually the admins stepped in. The mods stuck to their guns because they were tired of /r/technology not being about...well...gadgets. Back in the day /r/technology was a lot like /r/gadgets.

So the mods stuck to their guns, and the admins said ""fine, we don't agree with the direction you are taking this sub, so we can no longer keep you as a default subreddit""

The mods eventually did a number of things to try and be transparent and give users a choice, hence the pure tech filter. But it was too late. 

And ever since then /r/technology has been kind of....I don't know. An empty shell of what it used to be. Sure we get some active posts here and there. But the front page of /r/technology used to have hundreds if not thousands of posts on every post. 

Now there are tons of front page /r/technology posts which have 10-50 comments and that is it.

So anyway, there is your answer. There was a huge shit fit about this and it led to the fall of this subreddit."

3D Land is not so much a 3D Mario game. It's structured like a 2D Mario game, the mechanics is closer to a 2D Mario game, and the level design is also more akin to a 2D Mario game more than a 3D Mario game.

731889,video_games,"I like:  

-Nox: Love her outfits and even for old masteries, the dress looks stunning on her. I love her combo and all around grabbing people and letting my teammates destroy them is extremely fun to do. She's my first ever rank X and I'll never put her down.

-Awilix: Love how she plays, and her personality is absolutely adorable. Pulling people through the ground with her ult is one of the most satisfying things ever (seriously if you haven't done it, try pulling a Scylla or Hades that's under the gruond) and it shocks the victim. 

-Amaterasu: If it wasn't already obvious by my flair, I love Ama to bits. She can be built kinda tanky and still do reliable damage throughout a match. Her Foxy skin is the only Kawaii skin I've seen so far that doesn't annoy me at all with any incessant moaning *cough*Bastet*cough* and she's just really fun to play. She's also my second rank X.

I hate:

-Hun Batz: Honestly almost everything about him annoys the fuck out of me. His leaping monkey thing just screams every ten seconds, everything about his ult is aggravating from the fear to the goddamn bongo drums, and almost every Batz player I've had the displeasure of facing spams his taunt/laugh/joke whatever it is that makes him just fucking howl like he's in heat.

-Freya: The only reason I hate Freya is her stupid gumballs. I would have rather had her damage reduced than whatever her latest nerf did. If the nerf was to her damage, do it again.

TL;DR

-I like Nox, Amaterasu, and Awilix

-I hate Hun Batz and Freya"

Nope: Both ways they could've done that would've had a bad side-effect:

1. Release the PS4 on the same date (2013 November), but at a higher price.
2. Release the PS4 for the same price (399$), but at a later date.

If they'd charged more, sales would have been lower; but if they'd released the PS4 later, the XBox One would have gained huge popularity early on by being the only next-gen console available.

Overall, Sony made the right decision.

Similar to how Trump's team attempts to use propaganda to *destroy* trust in objective reporting and force them to reprint lies, rather than simply get the reporting to come across more favorably to them."

Ogbah had the most sacks on our team at 5.5 

&gt;Browns LB Emmanuel Ogbah totaled 5.5 sacks during his rookie season, which tied for 3rd in the league among all rookies. However, on average, Ogbah was one of the closest rookie defenders to the quarterback when rushing the passer as he had the 2nd best average separation from the quarterback at the time of release (4.35 yards).

The microsecond it detects wheel slip, it applies the brakes to that wheel. I know this because as someone who occassionally dabbles in rallying, it's the reason I didn't buy one. A few years ago they did allow you to turn the traction control completely off, but then decided against it as a company. So even accelerating that quickly shouldn't have broken traction - I'm guessing most of this is on the booze. "

2064565,news,"Everything isn't fine, but as far as the numbers go, the refugee intake has had no real effect on the crime statistics so far. The increase in rape isn't actually an increase in rape but a change in how rape cases are handled and what counts as rape. Not to mention that a lot of work over the years have gone into assuring people that there is no shame in reporting rape and for the police to handle it better(they as far as I know are better, but for obvious reasons they don't survey people). The biggest change is in the amount of coverage by the media. 

As for the bombings, they are an issue of concern, but they have fuck all to do with refugees in any case besides the ones where they are being bombed. Given that they have no actual opportunity to travel to the Baltic countries where on the black market the hand grenades get purchased I don't really see a reason to argue that they are the problem.

The biggest threat to Sweden isn't the refugees themselves, but the utter fail that is our integration policy. Realistically as long as refugees are placed in large groups they have little to no incentive to get to know any Swedish people, which doesn't facilitate integration. But I understand all three parties(government, refugees and Swedes) in this, as far as I can tell this would be the most common stance(no immigration and all immigration being the extremes and outliers with most people being somewhere in the middle). They get placed in the cheep places because they are cheep. If Sweden became a war torn hell hole forcing me and others to flee and where ever I end up they place me in an area where most of my neighbors spoke my language and knew my situation I can't say that I in my free time would spend it getting to know the locals.  As a local I understand how frustrating it is as it becomes a us vs them. Which is incredibly sad as it doesn't have to be that way. 

So, is the situation perfect? No. Is the situation horribly unmanageable with people getting blown up, shot, and raped all over the place? No. Could it be better? Sure, but as it could also be worse I don't think it's all that telling. Should we trust Trump on the matter? Only if you also think that eating sand is a good idea."

272463,video_games,"**Enter the Gungeon: Supply Drop Update**.  When I first played Gungeon, I said that it had replaced Isaac for me.  Then I went back and replayed Isaac, and realized that the lack of interesting, unique builds in Gungeon meant it could never replace Isaac, so I stopped playing Gungeon.  Then the supply drop update came out, and I've swung back around to saying Isaac has been replaced.  Not because there's a better passive:gun ratio than there was before or anything, or even really *anything* unique to the new update.  It's just all the stuff I originally loved about Enter the Gungeon coming back to me.  The fast movement with dodge rolls, the omnidirectional aiming, the general frenzied pace of the game, and the guarantee that your gameplay will fundamentally change depending on what guns you get I am having a blast, and when I try to boot up Isaac (in this case, only rebirth since I'm playing on the vita) I just... get bored.  Admittedly, I played a looooot of Isaac since the last time I had played EtG and maybe it's just getting old, and I do think Isaac has more staying power than EtG, but right now any time I play Isaac I just wish I could be playing EtG instead.  I'm also getting a lot better at the game-- I went from having killed nobody's past in 50+ games to killing three different pasts in four tries.

The one thing I'll say I don't like about the game, other than the lack of passives to make runs more interesting, is that too many items are unlocked through various shops.  A full run (not counting bullet hell) gets you about 12 credits, but just about everything I can buy costs 20-25.  Having to complete three runs just to add a single item to the pool is frustratingly slow,  and the update seems to have just added even more shopkeepers (which, I suppose, is great for people who have nothing to sink their credits into other than blessed runs).

**Deception IV: The Nightmare Princess**:  I knew what the series was going to be like (low budget, very japanese game where you set traps to kill ""good guys"") but I didn't realize just how... difficult the game would be.  Winning isn't super hard (at least, not the whole first stage that I've done) but getting your super elaborate traps to line up is easier said than done, and I ended up killing my targets just by messing up too many times before I could get them to work (or to fulfill requests).  Additionally, I don't particularly like that the only way I've found of getting your target to trigger a trap is to just stand near it and hope they path on it, and if they don't to just sort of run in a circle to reset them.  Plus, since the timing and pathing isn't super reliable, your first trap pretty much needs to be something instantaneous that either locks your target in place or (also instantaneously) moves them to a set position.  Not the worst thing in the world, but it feels like it's going to limit how elaborate I can make traps when the starter is guaranteed."

I also like to use it on tanks. Most tanks have an ability that protects them. Seeing my juicy robotic ass makes them forget about that ability until I put on some serious hurt. The alt fire presents the opportunity to either kill them instantly if you somehow land all headshots or at least force them to waste their heal/defensive ability and back off.

If I'm in combat range, it doesn't make sense to use it as you put out enough damage as Zen with your regular fire and have the support of your team without needing the burst damage."

My friends and I drove all over the central part of the city over the course of a weekend and there was nothing about what I saw that me think it was dirtier than NYC.

Much of NYC has been gentrified in the past 20 years, to the point that Manhattan and parts of Brooklyn and Queens are now unrecognizable from their state of disrepair in the 1970s.

Corsola doesn't evolve, nor do the other regionals, and they're not paricularly powerful (though I hear good things about Heracross, good for them). It's not like it's impeding your progress in the game, and if you're that obsessed about completing your pokedex I'm sure you'll find a way. 

If money is an issue then I guess you don't care enough about it to do anything? I understand that most of us don't make good money (I have no idea, I don't make a whole lot, myself), but if it's that important to you why wouldn't you set up a little savings to take a trip? It might take a year or so, but wouldn't that make it even more memorable when you finally do get to go?

How cool would it be to show off your Mr. Mime to friends and be like ""Yeah, we saved up and took a trip to Germany for a few days. Saw some amazing sights, ate all kinds of crazy food AND we caught a new pokemon!"" instead of ""oh hey, look at my Mr. Mime. I got it by cheating, I bet you don't have one.""

I guess it's just easier for people to whine and complain than it is for them to actually step up to the challenge. I assume most of the fussing is from kids who are too young to actually do any of this on their own, and I don't know what to tell them, but I'm just glad the direction of this game isn't being dictated by children.

They also had a tendency to jam frequently, were finicky to reload, and generally had fairly poor recoil.
