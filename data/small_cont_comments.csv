559409,1,"It's scary that his supporters cheered when he said he'd imprison his political opponent. They don't care about what's best for the country. They actually cheer about jailing people that disagree with them and, rather than speaking about what's best for the country, Trump just deflects to Bill or Hillary or minorities and his supporters eat it up.

He rambles incoherently and leaves us to fill in the blanks. He openly admits he doesn't discuss incredibly important issues with his running mate. He shows a clear lack of understanding of how even basic government or law works. But he tries to distract people by attacking his opponents or some minority. He makes up conspiracy theories, he lies, he contradicts himself, but as long as he attacks his opponents his supporters will just eat it up. They'll roll over and support him based on him attacking opponents; not based on wanting to do what's best for the country. 

It's scary that his supporters will vote for him based on ""Heh heh, he threatened and attacked his political opponents"" rather than voting for him based on what he'd do for the country. When you remove all the attacks, when you focus on policy and the country, Hillary has shown time and time again that she knows what she's talking about. She is leagues above Trump.

You know what's another way to say that? Fake news.

So the FBI was telling White House officials that there is fake news out there in a single story (doesn't mean all stories), and they tried to clean up the fake news. Now the media not only did not stop with the fake news, they keep repeating it and now they come out with stories that the FBI's description of the story as ""bullshit"" is no longer valid because the White House wanted that description repeated? What the fuck?

- Hillary 60%

We are a first past the post system which means we generate two candidates which have a realistic chance of victory.  Saying that ""it shouldn't be hard to get back to [representative democracy?]"" is one nonsensical because that's never been what we are and two is irrelevant because we were still a first past the post system this past election.

Being a pragmatic person, I don't solely blame third party voters.  I see multiple variables that contributed to Trump's victory - disenfranchised working class, smear campaign from the GOP, low voter turn out, third party voters, racism, etc.

What frustrates me is your (third party voters) inability or unwillingness to digest the *fact* that you are also part of the problem.  Spoiler candidates are a real thing whether you like it or not."

I'm getting so sick and tired of these facts being out there plain as day, but the whole country is just collectively like ""Eh."" and then shrug and say ""I'm with her."" 

It's nepotism and corruption at it's finest. But Trump (and I say this without sarcasm) actually is worse sooo....

Don't expect those health insurance premiums to drop (she's friend with the pharma industry) don't expect the voting systems to change (even if Maine pushes through ranked choice) Don't expect the Dakota oil pipeline to be stopped and don't expect her to realize that ""Oh, you mean fracking is sometimes bad?"" until she's poisoned half the goddamn waterwells on the east coast."

Are you sure? Much of the proposals pushed seem pretty anti-gun? 

&gt;Sure we think having proper background checks is smart

I believe the original proposal was a 2 week waiting period while it was processed through mail. real ""proper"". Then you want to force private transactions onto the aging NICS and introduce additional time, travel and cost to the right. Not anti-gun at all. 

&gt;and education is smart,

If you were pushing for public school equivalent of sex ed then yeah it would be smart. If it is a mandatory test before purchase then, no it is not very smart. Accidental injury and deaths for firearms are already pretty damn low, significantly lower than cars or even pools. I would expect an even lower requirement for guns, maybe card to remind purchasers of proper gun safety whenever they purchase a new gun. 

&gt; I really don't need a gun if society if functioning properly.

But there is never a guarantee that it will. There is never a guarantee you won't be attacked by someone desperate or stupid. Even well before this election."

Hillary is for bailouts and Obama care which isn't working at all- what's the point of universal healthcare if nobody can afford it? Trump is for a capitalistic approach Which in theory would keep prices low. Hillary is drafting women and trump isn't- sure fire way to reduce population is to kill the female population. Hillary is for ""helping"" African Americans by promising hot sauce?

Just because you change the trade relationship with a country doesn't mean there are no goods in the market. They will become more expensive, but this is something that dies out over a period of time.

Also, you talk about stoking ego like no businessman has ever done that to a politician before. The difference here is that unlike almost every politician before him, Trump did not take a campaign contributions for Wall Street or lobbyists (I don't think he took any). By contrast, Clinton spent over a billion dollars, including corporate interest money. He also doesn't have any lobbyists on staff.

Infrastructure is, to me, a cope out plan. It's not sustainable. FDR did it back in the 1930's to boost the economy. It seem like the Democrat solution because it's easy. The problem is it doesn't create permanent jobs or opportunities. By working with corporate interests to keep this good-paying jobs in our country, we keep permanent, good jobs.

Hitler preached class warfare, agitating the working class to resist “exploitation” by capitalists , particularly Jewish capitalists, of course. Their programs called for the nationalization of education, health care, transportation, and other major industries. They instituted and vigorously enforced a strict gun control regimen.

All I have seen against Trump is a trial by the media where anything goes, no swearing under oath, one side of the story, against the backdrop of a leaked tape of a disgusting remark made in a private conversation. Personally I find it quite crass but I don't consider virtuous discussions to be an important determining factor, ironically because such a person held office for 8 years, and I wasn't in favour of his impeachment either. 

If Trump has cases pending before the court he must face those charges. I only want Clinton to be treated the same way. Is that not fair? All we've ever wanted is for a court of law to judge Hillary Clinton. Can you at least concede that? Look at the utter travesty that is the FBI investigation. No due process of law, simply appointed government officials doing the job of the judiciary? Congress is furious, the judiciary isn't even consulted and the executive branch is determining innocence? 

If the allegations against Trump have merit he should face a judge. So should Hillary.

As far as the election is concerned, you should probably vote based on policy that you want the executive branch to enact."

Can you point me to specific emails that demonstrate actual collusion amongst the DNC rather than distaste towards a candidate who refused to drop out, continued to slander the DNC and the Democratic party as a whole despite having no mathematical chance at victory?

Most of the DNC emails in the leak weren't sent during the actual race, but about March/May when Sanders' defeat was cemented.

&gt; If they had split based on the actual percentage of votes, it would have been a different game from the beginning.

In terms of votes, Bernie still lost by a margin of 40% of his own voting base, losing by some 4 million votes to Clinton's 16 million. Hillary Clinton had 2814 delegates to Sanders 1893.

Nobody is born to be this way. It is inherited through society. For example, no black person starts off ""racist;"" but, after 20 years of being treated like shit by a certain type of person their community repeatedly, they find ways to adapt. 

I imagine there are analogous experiences no matter the racial heritage. Communities are *different.* And, I claim that ""liberty for all"" is contradictory to this ""integration for everyone"" stance.

Is there really something in ""liberty for all"" that says I can't choose who I want to associate with? Is there something in ""liberty for all"" that says as soon as you sit at my table, I can't get up and find another one?

I mean, not saying I would, but if I started a ""/u/HonoredPeople is garbage"" club, would I have to accept you? And, what's to keep me from shutting it down once you're in?

Polls have become more and more irrelevant over the past few years. As people lurch to the right in their private views they're still likely to put on a more moderate political face in their day to day lives. 

In the 2015 General Election and the 2016 Brexit Referendum vote the exit polls said that there would be a hung parliament and Britain would vote to remain in the EU. The complete opposite happened. People lied to pollsters at the exit polls. They didn't want to publicly admit they voted for racist nationalist parties in the form of the BNP or UKIP and a lot of people in Working Class areas just won't admit to voting Conservative because of negative social connotations.

The risk of polls being incorrect is a genuine possibility, especially with the small sample size we're seeing from some polls. I don't think Trump has a chance but please don't get complacent and assume that the job is done. Someone may seem like an gay-accepting friend to Muslims in public but the moment they get into the polling booth there's no stopping them voting for someone who'll get rid of LGBT rights and send refugees off to die in a war zone.

Oklahoman here, I'll be voting yes more than likely. I'm for capital punishment in extreme cases and from what I gather this is intended to allow the state to not lose the execution order by missing deadlines or some other bureaucratic mishap. 

A few years back there was a case where two men were set to be executed but the state couldn't get ahold of the cocktail they use for injection.

385233,1,Universal heath care lost in Colorado. Abolishment of death penalty lost in California. US is still a right wing country.
32828,1,"I wanted to add one more thing and didn't want it lost in an edit:

I think you're missing the fundamental truth conveyed by this article.  Let me put it this way:

1) Some racists voted for a black man with a Muslim name in 2008.  Apparently because they preferred his policies and were more moved by his campaign.  So they voted for him in spite of their racism.

2) Some not small number of those voters voted for a white man over a white woman in 2016.  It's likely that many of those voters are sexist.

This leaves us two possibilities:

1) Their sexism is much more deeply ingrained than their racism.  Meaning that they were able to overcome their racism based on policy and the strength of the campaign.

OR 

2) Their decisions were made largely by policy and the strength of the campaign, and the racism / sexism, while present, weren't major factors.

Having grown up in the midwest, I am extremely skeptical of the idea that their sexism was much more deeply ingrained than their racism."

Feel free to be enlightened. No educated person that has done the proper research can honestly say they are voting for Clinton because she is a good candidate. 

Before you call me a trump supporter it's unimportant. I'm voting third party. 


Edit: I typed a book on another thread here you go. 

No one with half a brain can say she is a good candidate who is a straight shooter and has this country's best interest in her mind. If they say it they either don't mean it or aren't competent to stand trial. 

I could write a freaking book. Everything I will state is FACT. Not what CNN or NBC says is fact. What is on paper from a cited source, or in the FBIs case report. 

She blatantly lied. Several times. There was classified emails sent on her private server. They were marked classified. She used more than one device. 

Her primary correspondent on the topic of Libya was Sidney blumenthal. Why is this of any importance. He had business interests in Libya and was a critic of the Obama administration. You can look up the archives of emails and search through them by keyword on multiple sites. Clinton said specifically that mr. blumenthals emails were unsolicited. But you can also look up various emails Clinton sent to Sidney that clearly ask for more intel. Asking him to send more intel clearly means the emails aren't unsolicited. She basically asked for the intel outright. All of the emails will come up under the key word search of blumenthal in one of the archives. Last but not least on this topic Clinton said herself that in her becoming the Secretary of State that she would basically cut ties with the Clinton foundation during her term. So where does Sidney blumenthal come into this one? He worked for the Clinton foundation. (Here is one of the only opinions I'll enter) that is PROBABLY why the Obama administration wouldn't let blumenthal work under Hillary. 

Let's move off of Clinton in the email investigation. All you have to do on this one is watch the testimony of her server admins. Just review it and think about what that means to you. Yes pleading the fifth is a constitutional right. But seriously? Is it necessary if you haven't done anything wrong? Don't want to argue that one much because they didn't do anything wrong. Just throws a red flag. 

Off to Lynch's testimony. Why tf would she not recuse herself in respects to transparency. Bill Clinton appointed her to the us attorney post in 1999. Obama appointed Hillary as well. So one prior and one present superior had significant ties to Hillary. This woman can't even answer if going 65 in a 55 is against the law. She admits to meeting with bill on the tarmac before her decision was final. How is that okay at all? Her testimony sounds as if she needs to pursue a career in defending criminals. She won't directly answer questions that would cast shade on her. She didn't even want to accept responsibility for the decision. (Another opinion) probably because she knows it's wrong, and she can use the defense that it's the FBIs decision. She got briefed on the evidence that lead the FBI to their decision. Look up the definition of brief. Yeah. The final decision can from someone who had very minimal knowledge on the topic. 

Huma abedin testified that the server was set up to conceal the emails. To who, you've gotta wonder. Clinton claimed convenience. 

It's all a sham. 

Unrelated topic. Who tf are the news stations polling? Look at a Clinton rally in Ohio. Then look at a trump rally in Ohio. 

Little crazy conspiracy here too. Comedy is on the board of a bank that donated to the Clinton foundation. 

Anything I may have misconstrued I'll be happy to be proven wrong. Most of what I stated is from facts and direct quotes or in writing from the FBI. All of which is apparent from testimony and documentation. 

I'm not voting for Hillary or trump so you can miss me with the trump supporter accusals also. I'm voting for harambe because a dead gorilla has less chances of fucking something up than both nominees of major parties."

It is depressingly clear that Trump's extremely misogynistic language and admission of sexual assault have not deterred the *majority* of men in this country from supporting him. That's not just worrisome, it's downright frightening. 

The data shows that the majority of men are absolutely out of sync with women in terms of their political preference, and that the majority of them support a candidate who considers women second-class citizens.

Generalizations are not necessarily bad when they are backed up by facts. Pollsters use the term ""voting blocks"" for a reason. Certain groups (e.g. religious, racial, gender) tend to exhibit certain voting patterns and political preferences.

178529,1,"Here is how I imagine they generate data to show Clinton ahead by 17 points or whatever they like... 

So you poll, let's say, 10,000 people. Well if I want to show Clinton ahead by quite a lot, perhaps I call, 7000 people from places like San Fransisco and New York City. and then, spread out the rest. 

This way, you get the result you want, without actually having to dirty yourself with *altering* the data. It's real data. Real people. Real answers. You just manipulated the conditions of the test to get the result you want. 

Why? 

Because telling people Clinton will win by a huge margin will make people stay home. It will make Trump supporters feel like they've lost already before going to vote. I think that, subconsciously, some people want to pick the winner. It doesn't matter who it is, they don't have to have a reason, they just want the person *they* voted for to win. The media has gone all in on trying to get Clinton elected, I don't see why they would waste this vector of attack. 

The media lied to you about the polls. The media lied to you about what Trump is. Everyone is mad at people who elected Trump, but they weren't the ones getting on national TV and told you that Clinton was going to win in a historic landslide and that Trump never had a chance. They (the media) weren't telling you what kind strategist Trump really was. They wanted you to believe him to be a racist, misogynist, fool. You wouldn't elect a fool, would you? You wouldn't be worried that a fool would actually win the election, would you? All the time they were deluging you with how horrible Trump is, they didn't really bother to mention how the DNC is imploding under it's own turmoil. They wanted a Clinton win so bad, they downplayed the fact that the DNC literally colluded to give her the nomination despite overwhelming support for Bernie Sanders, when they should have been putting pressure on her to step down. The only chance of stopping Trump in November was to pick Sanders and they failed. They failed because they put their own interests ahead of their constituents and electorate. They failed you. The DNC, the media, and Clinton. Not Trump supporters. And they were punished for it, because many people who supported Sanders in the primary went out and voted Trump or third party to punish Clinton and all the battle ground states fell to Trump. You don't need to be angry at people who voted Trump, you don't need to proselytize to them. You need to think about how the DNC is going to function and field a campaign for the next... 16 years, I would bet. It's going to be worse than the GOP was from '08-'16.  You want any chance at 2020? You need to weed out every person in the DNC that colluded against Sanders and hold them accountable for their actions. You need the media to stop assembling a narrative wrapped in their bias that furthers their own goals and to report information in an unbiased fashion. 

Further, when the people in charge are more concerned about where the email leak came from, rather than the content of the email leak proves they colluded to give Clinton the nomination should make everyone worried. They aren't denying what they did, they are upset they got caught and want to punish those who exposed them. That's the most troubling thing to come out of this election and if you believe otherwise you are a fool. The most likely explanation is the simplest one... a staffer with a USB stick, probably not a state sponsored foreign actor."

939450,1,"&gt; A lot of people comment how terrible Bush was but they'd take him in a heartbeat over Trump.

Bush the civillian is very different than Bush the president. Remember, Bush's relationship with the media was feeding Fox propaganda for his own ends. Ends that led to a war based on falsehoods that killed 200,000 iraqis, 1/3rd of which were children.

Bush is very religious and probably has to contend with the idea that, if he truly believes theres a judgment, that God will not look kindly on what was a 3rd-world dictator level of bloodthirstiness. If Qaddafi and Saddam are in hell, then GWB will join them.

Personally, I prefer Trump, if I had to pick. Trump dispenses with the bullshit facade that Bush was better at. Both are ultimately, just as evil, perhaps Bush edging him out considering Trump hasn't even started a major conflict yet and might not be incentivized to do so as he's mostly hands off on foreign policy and just wants the EU and Russia to run the international show. Hate to compliment Trump, if you can call it a compliment, but Bush has spent a lot of PR dollars whitewashing his image and I'm a little pissed to see how effective those PR dollars have been. Forgiving the Iraq conflict because he says nice things and paints now and again is asinine.


The Bush administration also followed the ""Firehose of Propaganda"" method which led to a dumbing down of conservatives which led to Trump's win. If anything Trump is the son of Bush."

Secondly, this isn't about the Quran or the Bible, this is about what the religion and it's people represent right now.  Right now, we are facing a radical islamic movement which is focused on fundamental Islam and a push for imposing Sharia law despite being specifically against the values of countries like the US and throughout the EU.  We're seeing this right now with the effects of refugees who can't assimilate into other cultures and instead force their beliefs and their cultures which are not appropriate with many being against the local laws.

&gt;And if an employee needs to use a personal email for conducting official business, he or she has an ""obligation"" to consult with the chief information officer and the assistant secretary for diplomatic security. However, Clinton did neither.

There are also laws.


&gt;The Laws

&gt;At issue are four sections of the law: the Federal Records Act, the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), the National Archives and Records Administration's (NARA) regulations and Section 1924 of Title 18 of the U.S. Crimes and Criminal Procedure Code.

&gt;In short:

&gt;The Federal Records Act requires agencies hold onto official communications, including all work-related emails, and government employees cannot destroy or remove relevant records.
FOIA is designed to ""improve public access to agency records and information.""

&gt;The NARA regulations dictate how records should be created and maintained. They stress that materials must be maintained ""by the agency,"" that they should be ""readily found"" and that the records must ""make possible a proper scrutiny by the Congress.""

&gt;Section 1924 of Title 18 has to do with deletion and retention of classified documents. ""Knowingly"" removing or housing classified information at an ""unauthorized location"" is subject to a fine or a year in prison.

The 1969 fire, which did not incur maximum damages or fatally wound any citizen, was the most covered incident occuring on the river.

Also, due to the shift from industry to technology, waste dumping to recycling Time Magazine produced an article about the incident.

But the economic blow dealt by the WW period crippled Britain's merchantilist capacity by eliminating much of it's industrial and business capital.  This isn't disputed.  The country still had representatives in Africa, Asia, and South America.  Those representatives simply weren't capable of defending colonial claim to property over the subsequent decades.  As this became increasingly clear, nativist organizations (often at the prodding of the Soviets) within the old empire rose up in revolt.

He didn't create ISIS, they came out of the insurgency in Iraq, shifted their focus towards Syria, and soon after the Free Syrian Army requested large amounts of weapons and received training from US intelligence/SO groups large amounts ended up defecting to either ISIS or Jabhat al-Nusra (now al-Sham).  They had large amounts of anti-tank TOW missiles which really allowed them to expand exponentially, as Syrian T-72s and T-60s weren't equipped to deal with that kind of firepower.

Obama didn't create ISIS, but he certainly augmented the problem.  And then Hillary was talking about how she wanted to establish a no fly zone over Syria which would have just impeded the Russian AF and Syrian AF.

*edit*  Also Obama highly expanding the drone program to also bomb in Somalia, Libya, and Yemen indiscriminately, often murdering innocents or hitting social events such as weddings, might have had something to do with the ease of recruitment these organizations faced... along with Erdogan being rather lax about the border didn't help much either."

384801,1,"Sanders never had to deal with negative advertising or campaigning. Further, in an election cycle where the nuances of Clinton's positions got completely lost in the fog, I'm not sure that a 72-year Jewish socialist - whose own, personal socialism is kind of hard to quickly explain - could've made the difference.

Trump's largest base of support came from the white, aging middle class. That group is historically and traditionally against increases in any kind of tax. That group is also at the tail end of the red panic from the 1950's and the 1960's. ""Socialism"" was a word that, for much of their generation, indicated someone traitorous to the very fabric of America. 

Sanders was promising them that their taxes would go up, in some cases, significantly, in order to support democratic **socialism**. I bold that, because that's exactly how it would been portrayed. Trump would've been banging away on Twitter and red-baiting Sanders six ways from Sunday in every rally, television appearance, drive-by cable news phone call, etc. 

I mean, for fuck's sake, the Republican Party convinced an awful lot of their supporters that the Affordable Care Act was going to get government involved in their Medicare. What do you think it would've taken to convince them that Sanders was calling for a Soviet-style revolution? How do you think the media would've responded? 

Instead of ""CLINTON INDICTMENT EXPECTED NEXT WEEK"", we would've seen endless headlines like ""SANDERS' SOVIET SYMPATHIES REVEALED"". 

So, again, no one can say if he would've done better. But before you assume that he would have, take a moment to think about the kind of campaign that would've been running against him, because that's the kind of campaign a Democrat is going to have to run against going forward. Trump's proven, definitively, that Americans don't give one fuck about the truth."
714157,1,"&gt; Sometime between March 25 and March 31, according to the FBI, a tech worker not identified in the report had what he called an ""oh shit"" moment. He realized that he had not done what Mills had ordered back in December 2014. In his first interview with the FBI, on Feb. 18, 2016, the unidentified staffer ""indicated that he did not recall conducting deletions based upon this realization."" But then, in a follow-up interview on May 3, 2016, the staffer ""indicated he believed he had an 'oh shit' moment and sometime between March 25-31, 2015 deleted the Clinton archive mailbox."" The staffer used the now-notorious BleachBit to do the work, and manually deleted a backup as well.

But the story is a little more complicated than that. The FBI found that on March 9, 2015, Mills sent the Platte River Networks staff, including the unidentified worker, an email, in the words of the FBI, ""referencing the preservation request from the Committee on Benghazi."" In his first interview with the FBI, the staffer told agents that ""he did not recall seeing the preservation request referenced in the March 9, 2015 e-mail."" But then, in the May 3 follow-up interview, the staffer ""indicated that, at the time he made the deletions in March 2015, he was aware of the existence of the preservation request and the fact that it meant he should not disturb Clinton's e-mail date on the [Platte River Networks] server."" The staffer also told the FBI he did not consult any colleagues, company legal counsel or anyone else ""regarding the meaning of the preservation request.""

According to the FBI, the Platte River Networks staff had a conference call with Kendall and Mills on March 31. By then, the deleting was done. What did they talk about? The FBI report says Platte River's attorney advised the staffer ""not to comment on the conversation with Kendall based upon the assertion of attorney-client privilege."""

Just a few months ago, reddit was outraged by the DNC scandals and her collusion with the media. Back then, few had an issue that these were leaked by Russia even though Clinton used this as her main line of defense. And it shouldn't matter that these are leaked by Russia. The damning information about the DNC and Clinton holds as much water regardless if it was leaked by a friend or a foe. The exception is if the leaked information is actually found to be fabricated, but this hasn't been the case. Do you guys wish that none of us known about the scandals that were going on with the DNC and the Clinton emails just because it's nowhere near as bad as a Trump presidency? 

What about the media digging up dirt on Trump so that he had by far the most coverage out of any candidate? How about the media propping Trump up as a pied piper candidate to try to push Hillary to win? How legitimate is it if special interests and the corporate media helped Hillary win the election? Just a few months ago, reddit was overwhelmingly against the collusion and the special interests controlling the media. Now the popular stance is how credible WashPo and NYT is for calling out the Russian involvement.

We're being manipulated by all sides now. And this is an inherent weakness with democracy.

- Trump University, which includes not only the people who got scammed and the Florida investigation, but also a similar story from Texas where the investigation into Trump U was quashed.

- The Trump Institute, another get-rich-quick scheme in which Trump allowed a couple of grifters to use his name to bilk people out of their money

- The Trump Network, a multi-level marketing venture (a.k.a. pyramid scheme) that involved customers mailing in a urine sample which would be analyzed to produce for them a specially formulated package of multivitamins

- Trump Model Management, which reportedly had foreign models lie to customs officials and work in the U.S. illegally, and kept them in squalid conditions while they earned almost nothing for the work they did

- Trump’s employment of foreign guest workers at his resorts, which involves a claim that he can’t find Americans to do the work

2.  Parts of Texas have fast growing groups of young Democrats / left-leaning Independents.

3.  Texas has a large Latino / Hispanic population which is also growing quickly.

4.  People are putting a lot of effort into getting the young people, and the Latino / Hispanic population to vote.

5.  A large number of members of Texas' conservative base are disheartened and likely to either not vote, vote 3rd party, or even vote for Hillary over Trump.

Trump will probably still win.  But, Hillary winning wouldn't actually be out of the realm of possibility.

Now, if ~~Trump~~ Hillary wins Alabama...then I will call shenanigans.

For the last 20 years, no economic sector has thrived like the internet.  Access is nearly ubiquitous, speeds are ever improving, and quality is generally superb.  Beyond this is the idea of regulating anything like a utility.  Utilities generally have fixed prices allocated politically, not economically.  Politically-fixed prices categorically allocate resources inefficiently and typically reduce investment in the sector.  For ISPs, if the regulator fixes the pricing structure, there is less incentive to invest in more robust future service.  As many economists point out: high and low prices cure themselves because of their effect on net investment.  Here are two quick sources on this one.  Net neturailities wikipedia page has some decent arguments as well.

434701,1,"There's no massive conspiracy to quell ""minority interests"" in the democratic party. The insidious part of ""identity politics"" is it values victimhood as its cardinal virtue; so any rejoinder that subverts or disputes any of their claims is automatically ontologized as an ""attack"" and subsumed into the larger narrative. 

The problem with ""identity politics"" is that it denies the individual their own identity. It tells us that your race/general/sexual preference is enough to know things about who you are and what you value which is _exactly_ the tactic that it proports to protect ""marginalized people"" from. 

In reality, people are more complex than their identities and their experience and individual choices tend to matter more. What's really happening here is a subset of the left has learned that certain topics are sacred cows and are exploiting the visceral reaction people have to them to gain political power. 

Don't agree with the lecturer coming to your campus? Want to silence them? It's not violating free speech; it's ""deplatforming"". They deserved it, they're a [insert label here]. The tactics are utterly pedestrian (albeit orwellian) and shouldn't confound even the basest of thinkers but these topics are so charged and the left is especially sensitive to come under accusation. It's all very witch-hunty. 

The great irony is: these people confirm the narrative of _real bigots_ who are telling their people that their group is under attack by the left. This, of course, confirms the SJWs' narrative that ""all X people are [label]"" and the two fringe groups feed off of each other while the sanest people in the room are left silenced. 

If the Democratic party wants to regain the support of working-class Americans they need to back-off this stance and get back to advocating for workers and the middle class.

EDIT:  my comment below 

Look, I'm an atheist. I think all religions cause problems. I also think different religions cause different problems.  The more extreme you become as a jain for example, the more of a pacifist you become. There is no interpretation that makes any kind of sense that results in violence. Christianity absolutely has interpretations that result in violence, but it also has a number of things that can tamp that down. Islam of course has sections that preach against violence as well, but unfortunately, we have the example of Muhammad, which will always make violence much easier to justify than the example of Jesus. Largely I think this is attributable to the fact that Christians were never in power when their books were written. But honestly, what is Isis doing that Muhammad didn't?  The fact that the prophet was a conquerer, and that the Quran is the direct word of God, makes it much easier for violent interpretations to take hold, and much harder to argue against. Do I agree with anything that trump is doing, or think we should single out Muslims? No, but I think it is insane to pretend all religions are the same and all are equally likely to produce extremism."

The ethics violations of the FBI leaks are so huge that I have come to the conclusion that they were ordered by the Kremlin. That's right. The KGB, or whatever they call themselves now, have spent years infiltrating agents into the FBI, and compromising the careers of the agents who might have caught them. The motivation is clear: The sources of information that are shared with the FBI are breathtaking, to the KGB. The ability to blackmail or otherwise compromise American politicians by KGB agents with the power of the FBI behind them is equally breathtaking.

But it appears that the KGB has overplayed its hand. By using these agents in such a public manner, they may be caught. It is general secret agent craft to operate in teams of 2 or 3, where one agent does the dirty deed, and the other(s) cover the tracks of the first, and even plant false evidence to put the blame on another person.

Violence and attacks in Israel are massively down, directly because of all the security efforts,  spending,  walls, and land annexation that Israel has done. These efforts work!

They would then have to show that PizzaGate remained up, and was active enough to have been moderated sooner. That it wasn't moderated properly by it's own mod team according to Reddiquite.

Spez's harassment, and temporary name edit, as a result of closing PizzaGate became a national story. So you take that, show that PizzaGate originated from T_D, and you show how poorly T_D is run according to Reddiquite. Then you show Spez, essentially apologziing and okaying in a way the actions that took place by PizzaGate and T_D users towards him, in spite of Reddiquite, and you have a case. 

Furthermore, Pao was ran off when she tried to clean up Reddit and hold it to the standard of Reddiquite.

I'm not saying that will happen, I'm just saying I could see something along that vein working against Reddit.

The bottom line is that you're supposed to follow the rules as a Reddit member, and if the mods aren't upholding the rules in their sub they need to either start, or be replaced. 

There is nothing wrong with support Donald Trump as President, and having a group following him on Reddit. They just need to obey and follow the rules like every other sub should be expected to do on Reddit.

This was actually why Trump became the Republican nominee.

Trump stood out, attracting a fringe minority vote.  The rest of the Republican primary voters, a majority at the time, split their votes among 2-3 other candidates, causing Trump's non-majority plurality to be #1.

This with [partial, conditional, and fully winner-take-all primary states](http://frontloading.blogspot.com/p/2016-republican-delegate-allocation-by.html) turned Trump's pluralities into unstoppable momentum even though he could not muster 50% popular support until late into the primary when it was too late.

53436,0,"Ok so this only works if you actually read and comprehend what I am saying. You are not referencing data your simply referencing that which supports your argument. These are two very different things. 

Either you believe we have been in a recession and hold Obama responsible for his portion and he is simply incompetent OR we are not in a recession and his economic policies are just garbage and have suppressed the otherwise recovered economy that of course we all barely noticed in the 7 years of garbage. Either way the economy under this president has sucked donkey balls since day 1. Now you may continue to say that presidents of any stripe have little effect on the economy and it simply is not true.  I already provided you with a perfectly good analogy but apparently you didn't read that either.  Presidents and leaders are very much connected to the environment in which the economy exists and are very much connected to the results.  Yes say it one more time they don't and one more time you will just dead wrong and factually inaccurate.

And now more failed reading opportunities on your part. I did not say it was a list of communists, I said it was a list of radicals ranging from anarchists - Bill Ayers his good friend who helped launch his political career. All the way to communist Mr. Davis.  Now I'm sure you fancy yourself a smart person so put on that thinking cap - Obama credits him for forming his ""black identity"". Now let's think on that, we got a mixed kid, with no father, bounced all over the world now living with grandma and grandpa who are white and introduce young Barry to Mr Davis cause you know - all my black friends are communists he is just their card game pal I'm sure. Now this man helps form that kids ""black identity"" - hmmmm maybe your right I am sure a person entire cultural identity can just straighten itself out in one or two good talks. NOTE: you are allowed to use common sense when consuming information. And yes Elizabeth Warren is a communist - you do realize that just because you don't call yourself a particular thing if everything you believe still matches you are in fact, that thing - true enough you may well find touches of facism in ms warrens belief system but I mean your splitting hairs really.

Trump didn't even make the ""Mexicans are rapist and criminals"" statement you are referring to without then framing it as not all of them. You will have to google the speeches now - all the commercials providing your data aren't running anymore. But by all means go watch the speeches and lucky you the complete sentences and full context will all be right there for you if you want to look. I will have to google all these reversals you say mr Byrd made - I am sure his mea culpa is all over the net.

The EC has gone against the popular vote 5 times not a few not twelve - exactly 5 times there fact lover.  I got in this argument because Trump is no more a demagogue than Obama was my only point has been your refusal to accept that because you don't agree with the ideology and no your refusal to do so is not fact based. It is tribalist because you only hear the parts that you want hear - that is what tribalism is, it is what you are doing right now.

Incidentally the purpose of the electoral college is not today, nor has it ever been a check against anyone getting elected. I don't know where you come up with this stuff but that has never been the purpose of the EC. Now here is a hint -- in order for you to argue that you would need to reference the fine gentlemen who created and implemented the EC system. What Michael Moore and Rachel Maddow tell you about what one of their professor buddies told them is not relevant. And whether you like it or not every stereotype has a basis in fact otherwise the stereotype would not exist. Applying hyperbole to a stereotype is just for emphasis and flare."

That's why I said ""Let's say"" that happens. Because let's just say that you're wrong on this assumption, the polls end up being predictive and Hillary wins the states that Nate Silver expects her to win.

&gt; And they'd be cost effective if we could keep them there as long as a robot mission.

There's no way you could possibly think this. Rovers will always be cheaper than humans, even if it were possible with today's technology to put humans on mars for multiple decades as you seem to think we should. Life support is heavy and expensive."

But then I remember that he is a legitimately evil person, an actual fascist who would harm millions of people in different ways if he ever came to power, a man with a history of sexual assault who was accused of marital rape by his first wife.

900699,0,"&gt;The word ""Muslim"" does not appear anywhere in Trump's travel order. So you're wrong there.

Okay, now I know you are just putting on your blinders. He called for a ""Muslim ban"" he then asked juliani how to do it legally, these are both fully documented and true, to ignore these is to ignore reality.

In 2013, 25% of all deportations were carried out by the agency, up from 17% in 2012. Meanwhile, the number of deportations carried out by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which deports people caught both at the border and the interior of the country, fell in 2013 compared with 2012.*

*This rise in the number of deportations also coincides with stalled growth of the U.S. unauthorized immigrant population since 2009, and a more recent rise in the number of apprehensions at the U.S.-Mexico border. In 2013, there were 414,000 apprehensions at the southwest border, a rise of 27% over 2011 (the most recent low in apprehensions).*

The rebellion was caused because of taxes, but carry on. They hated freedom of religion just as much as the next guy; if you dive into the writings of Franklin or other you'll see how they wanted America to be a protestant-Christian nation. In fact, laws going against the first amendment itself were passed only years after the union was created. 

&gt; You're a little fascist

Technically, no. Fascism promotes third way economics, social traditionalism, and policy for the collective not the individual. 

I really only hit the mark on the second, social traditionalism, as at the core my views promote smaller government and more libertarian leanings than pretty much everyone. If you look at my posts, you'd see I only promote non parasitic government intervention and free market capitalism. 

I don't make a great deal of effort to deny the label, however, seems how I realize that most think of fascism as state enforced social traditionalism, and ignore the economic aspects of it entirely. I usually use the word neo-reactionary or classical conservative.  

&gt;  there would be no freedom of speech 

That's true to a degree. Free speech and dialogue can be helpful, but can only be established under the right conditions. As it stands, my political rivals wish to do anything possible to get there way. I have no choice but to fight fire with fire. Even then, some limitations must be placed, as the integrity of the culture is above that of ones ability to speak. 

&gt; freedom of mobility, of association

Yes there would. Freedom of association is literally one of the most important things to me. 

&gt; Opposition to the ruling party would be criminalized.  

Depends what the party is. 

&gt; You hate democracy

Yes, I'm a monarchist. 

&gt; freedom 

Freedom is a useless word, in general. But I think I know what you're getting at. I'm against social ""freedom"", which is important to you, so you just ignore my ""freedom"" positions of economics. 

&gt; Just admit you fucking hate America and what it stands for.

Do you mean current America, or the America the founding fathers envisioned? Because I'm certainly in favor of a small government, Christian-Conservative, free market based Anglo-European nation state.

6 months ago I would have thought it was ridiculous too, but honestly, all signs seem to be pointing that way. Trump has been cooing at Russia and sneering at China throughout his entire campaign.

I honestly think the agreement could be something as simple as ""We'll look the other way while you take your new Soviet Union by force if you don't interrupt us trying to thumb down China"". It's a terrible deal for the US, but not for Putin, who unlike Trump is not stupid.

I mean look at all of Trump's anti-NATO rhetoric, for instance. It is the precursor to ""Its up to them to defend themselves from Russian takeover"".

However, we can't simply normalize annexations like this or Crimea.

The problem here is that *instead* of going to court to get his conviction overturned, the guy accepted a deal from a judge to get out of prison quicker if he agreed to a resentencing to ""time served"".

Basically:

1. He was in prison
2. New evidence came to light that indicated he was innocent
3. He went to court to get his conviction overturned
4. The judge offered him a short-cut to accept the conviction and be resentenced to get out of prison quicker, but keep the conviction on his record, **which he agreed to**
5. He was released, having spent his sentence, with the conviction still on his record
6. He **changed his mind** and decided that he also wanted the conviction removed from his record
7. Instead of going to court to establish whether he could have the conviction overturned, he went straight to the governor for a last-resort pardon
8. The governor rejected the request on the basis the pardon is supposed to be a last resort, and he should have gone to court to try to get the conviction overturned before approaching the governor, and hadn't

Also,  notice I said I am not ok with the government stepping in,  but I am totally cool with them feeling societies wrath (losing business because of their stance). 

BTW,  in many ways the government already does agree with my stance.  Employee discrimination laws actually only apply to businesses of atleast a certain size (in most states atleast). That's why the Chinese restaurant down the street is all Chinese workers and aren't getting sued.

Ok, sure, but as I've said elsewhere, the current state of renewable resources is not sufficient to provide energy and heat for all Americans. Even if we stopped expansion of Oil and Gas I have serious doubts that the reallocation of funds would be sufficient to provide for the rise in energy demands that we have.

Renewable resource funding will be going into R&amp;D, not growth and expansion (for now, and for the most part). That means that for each dollar spent, you won't get as much energy out of renewables as O&amp;G (currently, in the future, hopefully we will). If we have an urgent need for increasing energy production, which I believe we do, then it will be difficult, if not completely impractical to pull large amounts of funding from O&amp;G expansion.

I'm also a 20-something year old, and I totally see that it's a dark future, but O&amp;G is a tried and true method of energy production, and in situations where demand is high, the non-risk takers will always flock towards the tried and true methods."

When people without insurance get seriously sick / hurt they still receive care when they go to the hospital.  Those bills are so high that many can't pay and just declare bankruptcy - medical bills are by far the #1 cause of personal bankruptcy in the US - so the hospital incurs the costs of treatment but doesn't get much of the revenue to cover it.  Those costs are just passed onto the rest of us via inflated medical bills and higher insurance premiums.  

And to top it off, treating severely injured / sick people is generally much more expensive than prevention or early diagnosis / treatment. But people without insurance don't bother with prevention or early diagnosis.  So not having insurance leads to under-spending on prevention and early diagnosis, raising total costs, which the uninsured can't pay, thus passing that on to the rest of us!  YAY!!"

However, shifting demographics has nothing to do with this. It is a fact that will not, barring extreme measures, be changed.

Catholics are an interesting group, they are much less likely to be single-issue voters than other groups that identify strongly by their religion. They are more likely to organize and do groundwork for parties than most demos (this is largely attributable to their large union membership). They historically supported Catholic candidates in massive (like 60 point massive) numbers, but have seemed to completely stopped this trend in recent history (Kerry experienced this first hand in both the primary and general in 2004). They also separate themselves from most other religious-identifying groups by polling at or above 50% in favor of legal abortion.

In surveys, a large portion of Americans failed to even properly define basic insurance terms - deductible, copay, co-insurance, out of pocket maximum, premium.

Sorry for the wall of text and numerous citations; I prefer my opinions to be formed from consideration of knowledge, facts, and reasoning; not my feelings, which are fleeting and can not be cited. My stance is that the Obama administration did what it thought to be best at the time they were required to take decisive action, after accounting for the nearly infinite variables. The United States' international military operations do not happen in a vacuum, there are far ranging implications and effect more than the specific mission to which they are tasked.

250576,0,"&gt;I explained how FPTP only applies to the aftermath. The fact that we have had more than two major parties in this country demonstrates how just chanting the mantra of FPTP doesn't magically make it a two party race.

But that is thinking of it in one cycle. FPTP affects this cycle before hand because of the last cycle. It does not only apply to the aftermath, your logic is flawed.

I am not saying, ""not now, wait"" You've completely misunderstood me. My goal is to change the voting system to allow for a larger plurality of political parties. This begins by supporting local politicians with this goal in mind, and educating citizens about the benefits of voting systems such as run-off voting, ranked, or the alternative vote. 

This means supporting candidates that are most likely to help achieve that goal. Working within the confines of FPTP, Hillary Clinton is that candidate. Mostly because I don't believe this country can survive and flourish under 4 years of a Trump presidency. We have a 49.4 chance of Trump, who in my opinion, will greatly diminish American democracy and set us back at least a decade, we have a 49.4 chance of Clinton, who will be status quo, with a chance of advancing social injustices and installing things I like such as a single payer system, and better education, while supporting the middle class. We have a .2 percent chance of Johnson, who I am still meh about. So my choice is pretty obvious."

78086,0,"Simple. 

Help me out here, since you seem to have a better grasp of the situation at hand then I. I just read the news, and see what I can find. 

So, we have the people in georgia (http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/dec/9/georgia-election-officials-accuses-dhs-hacking-sta/) saying they don't need help from the DHS. As may be stupid, but as is their right. 

Then, someone with a DHS IP attacks their networks firewall. 

I see a couple of possible cases here. 

- The DHS does not know their asses from their ellbows. They have a laxer security for on network devics then the clinton server staff for external consultants and email deletion, and allowed one of their devices to be captured. Their internal audits, if present, failed to capture or even recognise the intrusion. In this case, the fear was justified, and apparently, thanks to the DHS's fucked up perception of their own invulnerability, they aided the russian hacker. I would expect something like this in a third world cesspit, not in america. For someone in latvia, that runs a potato, it would be acceptable to say, dude, we fucked up, our bad. For someone in the US: unacceptable. 

- Someone topside has contacts to the russians. Goes over and hands over his codes to the DHS, and thus gains them access to their servers. in which case, the DHS failed to protect their system, their entire system has to be taken offline and scrubbed, creating a massive vulnerability (Of course, the possibility exists to just continue with a bug in their system, and just hope it won't happen again), and the person whose access was used should be shipped to guantanamo for a round of enhanced interrogation. 

- The DHS intentionally exploited the weakened security of georgia, either intentionally, or unintentionally, to the russians, or whomever, either by handing over their knowledge of the system, or by allowing this to happen. You know, like the famous terrorism plots that just happen to be under the controll of the CIA and others the entire time. 

- The DHS decided to go rogue and punish the georgians that did not want to givce it access to its systems, by fucking with those systems. 

My perception thus far: 

- The DHS presents a single point of failiure. You do not want a single point of failiure with all the access. Because if that single point of failiure falls, the entire thing falls. Multiple redundant points of failiure. Since perfect security does not exist, the next best thing is to make an attack take so long and be so complicated that someone has a chance to notice it and pull the plug. 

So.......

With this being present, and with the news story on how the intelligence community fucked around with this being swept under the carpet, while ""we are sure it was the russians, says intelligence community"" being given ample light: 

- does that sound like professionalism to you? 

- does that sound like impartiality to you? 

- could it be that, in light of the happenings, that there is more to this story then we would get if we only trust one side? 

- does it sound like before any conclusions being drawn that could be acted upon, there should be a thorough investigation of ALL involved parties? And I mean, from the computer of the chief of the DHS branch where the attack seemingly originated to the computers in georgia, and the DHS should be kept OUT of the loop as much as possible, untill their complete sweep and audit of their systems and personell is performed? I mean, not for nothing, if the DHS and the FBI and the NSA wanna sa, we think it could have been the russians, great. Mark it as an oppinion piece, and good. 

In total, I am not a betting man, but I would look out for openings in the DHS section regarding computer networks, voiluntary leaves, and so forth. 

Plus, as sad as that may be, I would bet at least a pack of cigarettes that the relevant personell now run an increased risk of accidents with the most mundane of activities, compared to the average american. I am happy if I am wrong and have to buy someone else a pack of cigarettes, but considering the clinton death cluster, I would not be so sure."

The Supreme Court struck it down as unconstitutional because it did not contain sufficient due process verbiage, specifically in regards to consideration of the health of the mother. Then just 3 years later, Bush signed a federal law banning that very thing, then replaced Justice O'Connor with more conservative Justice Alito, and the court once again made a decision on whether or not it was fine for the federal government to make vague mandates on what should be medical decisions. And this time they said that it was fine, with the majority opinion stating: ""a health exception was unnecessary."" Did it completely outlaw abortion?

346946,0,"&gt;You refuse to rebut arguments, which I have put in bold several times, that defeat your points.

I'll now rebuke your bolded ""argument,"" *again,* that you edited into you comment after I started replying.

&gt;The very first thing I did was mention the actual rape cultures which exist in certain parts of the Middle East and Asia. It was in my very first comment. And in fact, I repeated it in bold earlier so that you wouldn't be able to avoid addressing the point, but you straight-up purposely avoided it anyways. You refuse to address that comment, because you know it tears apart your ridiculous claim that ""we live in a rape culture,"" and until you refute my point, your own stance is defeated.

I addressed this:

&gt;All you did was deny we live in a rape culture using a very specific definition which deviates from those that coined the term and developed upon it. You didn't actually make a point. Your argument is, ""well it's worse in other cultures, so we're fine,"" while ignoring all political context about the term.

You then agreed on the definition I gave:

&gt;We know that at its core, our society is not something that outwardly promotes rape, as the phrase could imply. That is, we don’t, after all, “commonly engage” in sexual violence “together as a society.”

&gt;To understand rape culture better, first we need to understand that it’s not necessarily a society or group of people that outwardly promotes rape (although it could be).

&gt;When we talk about rape culture, we’re discussing something more implicit than that. We’re talking about cultural practices (that, yes, we commonly engage in together as a society) that excuse or otherwise tolerate sexual violence.

The very simple argument I gave based on this definition, which you have yet to challenge:

&gt;What am I making up? They voted for him, he has a history of sexual assault. If they didn't tolerate or excuse it that means they wouldn't vote for him. Thus they are either tolerating or excusing it (his history of sexual violence). [Parallel to our definition of rape culture: ""We’re talking about cultural practices (that, yes, we commonly engage in together as a society) that excuse or otherwise tolerate sexual violence.""]

&gt;The only case where this could be invalid is if they weren't aware of his history, which would make them ignorant voters which is also not okay.

&gt;In the full interview, it's clear Obama is urging Latino citizens to vote in order to give voice to members of their community who are precluded from doing so by lack of citizenship, not urging non-citizens to vote illegally. Rodriguez's question seems to be addressing a fear that voting will result in scrutiny on one's family which could result in deportation of undocumented relatives:

&gt;RODRIGUEZ: Many of the millennials, Dreamers, undocumented citizens -- and I call them citizens because they contribute to this country -- are fearful of voting. So if I vote, will immigration know where I live? Will they come for my family and deport us?

&gt;OBAMA: Not true. And the reason is, first of all, when you vote, you are a citizen yourself. And there is not a situation where the voting rolls somehow are transferred over and people start investigating, et cetera. The sanctity of the vote is strictly confidential in terms of who you voted for. If you have a family member who maybe is undocumented, then you have an even greater reason to vote.

&gt;RODRIGUEZ: This has been a huge fear presented especially during this election.

&gt;OBAMA: And the reason that fear is promoted is because they don't want people voting. People are discouraged from voting and part of what is important for Latino citizens is to make your voice heard, because you're not just speaking for yourself. You're speaking for family members, friends, classmates of yours in school...

&gt;RODRIGUEZ: Your entire community.

&gt;OBAMA: ... who may not have a voice. Who can't legally vote. But they're counting on you to make sure that you have the courage to make your voice heard."

&gt; Median wages have been stagnant to negative, but that's not because of inflation. Inflation is simply the decrease in the purchasing power of the dollar.

LMAO! I'm a charicature of a stereotype and you cant critically think about what it is that causes the destruction of the dollar!!!




&gt;If you have savings, they should be (at a minimum) in some sort of bonds or money-market account that will grow at or above inflation.

If I had gold based dollars there would be no bankers and  their debt based dollar making me poorer!

And why should I have to gamble my savings because you want to make bankers richer by putting us all in  debt?


&gt;If you are working, your wages should rise faster than inflation (a 5% annual raise will beat inflation). In fact, the top 40% of households have seen their real incomes rise over the past 40 years. The problem is that the economic gains of the past 40 years have gone primarily to the wealthiest among us.

It's gone to the bankers because we have a debt based dollar that makes them richer!



 
&gt; Your viewpoint is incoherent.

No it's not. We have  debt based dollar that makes bankers rich and you have stated that because of that we have to gamble on stocks or other instruments so we dont lose out!

All you are doing is defending the bankers ability to put us in debt to them!

There is always  going to be a minority, and despite what you claim, California and other large states hold a very large portion of political power in this country. 11 of the largest states can elect the president. Without the EC, no politician is going to give two shits about Maine, or Alaska, etc except for thy few from those states.

Take a look at Catalonia in Spain (See [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/5d1jqn/eli5why_do_such_places_as_catalonia_and_quebec/da13eir) post).

Yet the White House public schedule for that day lists no such meeting — and no PDB meeting. So the entire controversy appears based on a semantic distinction — or perhaps inaccurate White House schedules.

Obviously the hardcore Trump voters would not have been persuaded in any event, but plenty of reluctant Trump voters exist. I think maybe your confusion here is stemming from an assumption that all Trump voters are basically the same, which is pretty ironic given the subject. Even if you do feel all Trump voters were irredeemable, the same argument would apply to people who chose to stay at home and not vote at all.

I understand that being polite towards people you disagree with can be tiresome. I also understand that there are some people it's not worth being polite towards. I also understand that sometimes Republicans make complaints that are hypocritical.

The other didn't continue an attack after warned. 

&gt;Moreover used to interfere with the senate's obligation to investigate presidential candidates.

It interfered with nothing. She purposely did it. Another Democratic senator went to the Senate Parliamentarian and asked her how he achieve the same effect as Warren without running afoul of the rules, and he did. The reading only needed to be changed slightly. Of course, he didn't do it in the context of obviously trying to call another senator racist, so that surely helped. 

&gt;More than irrelevant.

You keep saying that, but it remains untrue.

&gt; It in no way excuses interfering with the senate's obligation to fully vet presidential candidates.

They did fully vet Clinton, and without having to do what Warren did. Clinton is proof positive that this rule does not interfere with the obligation to vet nominees. Republican senators had a million chances to disparage the character of Clinton on a long list of things in her past, and none of them did it. Warren knew she was unnecessarily violating the rules, and did it anyway so she could play the victim."

577652,0,"&gt;...And in particular, Trump is speaking to the idea, propagated through conservative media, that Barack Obama stole the 2008 and 2012 elections by using fraud and other nefarious tactics in cities like Philadelphia.

&gt;The ""evidence"" for this is Obama's high support in a handful of inner-city areas. In 2012, for instance, there were precincts in Philadelphia and Cleveland where Obama won nearly 100 percent of the vote. These predominantly black neighborhoods backed the president with overwhelming support, as they had in the previous race against John McCain. This wasn't unusual. Given the size of the country, the number of voters, and the extent of residential and political segregation, these unanimous areas — in Philadelphia, 59 divisions of several hundred voters each — were inevitable. 

&gt;Indeed, it happens for Republicans too. In 2008, McCain won 80 percent or more of ballots cast in counties across the interior South, despite losing the general election by 7 percentage points. But this dynamic was more pronounced in hyper-segregated communities of black Americans, an electorate that, according to exit polls, backed Obama with average support of 94 percent in his two elections. Statistically, there was a decent chance that one nearly all-black precinct or another was going to vote unanimously for the president.

&gt;But to many conservatives, this was suspect. On his syndicated radio show, Hannity said that it was ""mathematically impossible"" that no one had voted for Mitt Romney in these areas and that therefore, it ""means we've got cheating going on in our elections."" Hannity's disbelief echoed across right-wing media, where outlets like Breitbart and Townhall ran with the claim that voter fraud skewed the results in cities like Philadelphia and Cleveland. When considered in the elaborate canon of right-wing media, where marginal groups like the New Black Panthers stood as a threat to the voting rights of white Americans, the message was clear: Black voters had broken the rules and stolen the election from Romney for a black president...

So the Republicans gerrymander all the districts, drawing crazy zigzagged districts to guarantee they win, packing African-Americans into 100% Democrat districts, then when the Democrats 'surprisingly' win those districts, these same Republicans howl about 'cheating'? About 'voter fraud'? About 'skewed results'? What is the matter with them?"

342849,0,"Why is this so hard for people to grasp? I'm not knocking you personally, I just dont get why people dont seem to understand how the electoral college is set up, particularly people who at the same time seem to be hoping the electoral voters will break the law and vote faithlessly to install Hillary.

Hillary was able to win the popular because she won the cities. In urban areas with dense populations she carried the vote big-time. But Trump had more broad support spread across the states. Take Pennsylvania... Hillary won more votes in heavily populated cities like Philly and Pittsburgh, but she lost the state because more people across the state voted for Trump. In the states where she won both electoral and popular votes, other than California the Dem leading states just dont have enough electoral votes to really swing it one way or another. So even though she carried much of the Northeast for example, it wasn't enough, because although those populations add up to a lot the individual states themselves don't have enough electoral votes to make a difference.

This election really came down to urban areas vs. everyone else, and rural/suburban areas carried the day for Trump.

As it is, this is actually the purpose of the electoral college and proof that it is working. The whole idea behind it is to make sure that densely populated urban areas dont swing the vote one way or another and completely snuff out the voting voice of the rest of the state that city is in. Even if the rest of New York voted red for example, NYC would have enough population to swing the vote away and make it blue. The electoral college protects from that happening.

What it is not set up for, is for electors to intentionally go against the will of the voters in their state. The electors dont vote on the basis of the whole countrys population they vote in the interests of the majority of the state. So even though Hillary had the nationwide popular vote, the electors are still called upon to vote in the interests of the voters in their own state. The only time a lot of electors have tried to vote faithlessly and against the will of the population was so that a bunch of slaveholders could hang onto their political system. Its one of the reasons we now have laws against it, even if it is just a fine to be paid in most there are laws against voting against the people's voice."

She said she didn't send classified info, they could prove she did and it still wouldn't be perjury.  Perjury requires that she actually knew that she did then lied about doing it.  It's nearly impossible to prove without admittance post doing it or some obvious planning before doing it.  This is why the FBI didn't pursue charges.  Based on the law she didn't break it.  

So why did Paterous get charged?   He admitted to knowingly giving over information that he knew at the time was classified and did it to gain from it.  The key is he had intent which is required by this statute."

503975,0,"Paul Rieckhoff, of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America is responding to this.  Some quotes (from his twitter feed):


""Every national leader has a responsibility to use accurate and appropriate language when talking about mental health and suicide especially.""

""Terms like ""killing yourself"" or ""mental problems"", or any any suggestion that suicide only impacts the weak, perpetuates stigma...""

""...it can also promote contagion and may discourage people from getting help for mental health injuries. Getting help is a sign of strength.""

So, maybe everyone is freaking out and taking words out of context, etc.  But, it's a perception thing.  Talking about PTSD and ""strength"" (or lack thereof) shows a lack of understanding in general about mental health.  Also, talking about the ""people in this room"" could imply a sort of ""oh, but I don't mean YOU"" mentality, creating the perception that PTSD is something to be ashamed of, and reassuring those in the room that he doesn't think they aren't strong.

Or, my original thought on hearing the ""in this room"" bit was to wonder if he meant literally, as in ""physically present, still alive"" as opposed to people who have committed suicide - but that is likely reaching.

Though...isn't that part of the issue?  That at this point with some of the things he has said bluntly - no one can really be sure what he means or is intending to convey?  My sense is that he feels he is quite clever and is able to speak so slyly that he can get away with insulting people in a slick way - then claim a misstatement or that he was being sarcastic or kidding.

Edit:  Extra credit.  White people are a smaller percentage of the democratic caucus compared to the Republican Caucus.  So not only are more Republicans White, but more of those whites (by 42% more) hold racist beliefs.  

Let's say both caucuses were 100 people.  Let's say Republicans are 80% white and Dems are 60% white.  That means that 22 Republicans whites hold racist beliefs and 11 Democratic whites hold racist beliefs.  That means the Republicans have 100% more whites who hold racist beliefs."

As a far left liberal one of the hard parts is my experiences with this is so different.  I often have to pause and remind myself of it.

Gay marriage isn't new to me, I am 30, I was introduced to my uncle and his boyfriend when I was 6. I was the ring bearer in their marriage a handful of years later. In high school we had numerous activities to bring attention to mistreatment of gay students.

To me gay marriage is an OLD issue, its like 15-20 years old.  So in my world we have had 20 years to adjust to gay marriage and people are still having issues.  Its hard to fathom that to some people they really only started thinking about gay marriage recently because that seems to crazy compared to my life experiences. 

I think a lot of times this is the miscommunication that causes issues.  The city-dwelling liberals are getting involved in these progressive causes decades before they make it onto Fox News (which is likely the first time the rural conservatives are forced to think about the issue).

Before the game I noticed exactly two groups of people playing up the association between Donald Trump and the New England Patriots: people who love Donald Trump and people who hate the New England Patriots. For one surreal moment, all sorts of bright lines became blurred. Facebook friends who normally posted in support of BLM were suddenly posting tweets from Richard Spencer, just to support their shared narrative that the Patriots were the ""Make America Great Again Team."" 

The absurdity is what was so instructive. When your black female Colts fan friend can find common ground with literal Nazi, and that common ground is the New England Patriots, it becomes a lot easier to understand how a reality star could be elected president of the United States."

This is not an equal matchup in terms of which person is clearly more bigoted and willing to have that bigotry manifest as laws and policies.

615959,0,"No. They are not evidence. I understand that everyone is armchair lawyers but ""oh yeah she told me it happened"" is not proof of anything except that at the time, she told someone she was molested. And for about the fifth time, her claim IS NOT PROOF. It is her word against his. If you go into a courtroom and say ""This man attacked me and beat me up"", but you have no bruises or lacerations and the only thing corroborating your story is a friend who says ""oh yeah she told me she got beat up"", they are not even going to accept the case.

You also don't seem to understand the difference between direct evidence and circumstantial. The professor's testimony is circumstantial; he did not witness the act, he only heard something that could help corroborate her side of the story. And her testimony is not evidence, it is the claim itself; the claim cannot be evidence as evidence has to support the claim, and if the claim was evidence that would just be circular logic and wouldn't make any sense.

Let me put it this way. Right now, I could easily go tell someone that Donald Trump molested me, with the intent to take him to court and get money out of him. That person comforts me and talks me out of it; I feel less secure now and Ive decided it isnt a bad idea. But suddenly, years later, he starts getting multiple accusations. Hey, I can jump on the bandwagon because I already set up my swindle! So I come out, and have support because of the lie I told originally.

Again, this is Devil's Advocate stuff, I obviously dont think that's what happened, but that is exactly what Trump's lawyers would claim if she brought it to court and without actual evidence to back it up - an eyewitness to the incident, pictures of marks he left on her, security footage, etc - she would not have enough to make a real case."

All this information is originally reported, and wikileaks is not the source.

I have been forthright about the fact that Julian Assange of Wikileaks and I share a common friend who has communicated with both of us. I was simply told Wikileaks was in possession of ""political dynamite"" that would ""rock Hillary's campaign"", and they would release it in late October.

I had no previous knowledge of the subject of the disclosures, although I've speculated that it would be related to the Clinton foundation. I've had no advance knowledge of the hacking of Podesta or anyone else. Nor do I believe that Assange is an agent of the Russians, a charge which is yet undocumented with proof and which he denies."

I do agree that the environmentalists would still be unhappy about the oil industry, but how many people would follow them in it?

The left better learn that they need to take the high road after this election. They tried to fight fire with fire and insult and demean the right. The right responded by unifying against the exclusive message the left preached. Yes, Trump preached exclusion too, but he did so while pandering to the largest, most reliable voting bloc in the nation. The left *can't* win without them and the right *can* win without minorities (as they don't reliably vote anyway, and a good enough amount of them are conservative). 

The left likes to act as if they're all inclusive while taking the white, uneducated voters for granted or dismissing them as unimportant in the face of all other minorities.

One commenter chimed in ""That might have something to do with the epidemic of Marxist professors at Universities.""  
  
Marxist.  How often does one hear the word *Marxist* used in modern political conversation?  Certainly it comes up from time to time, but still it seemed like an odd word choice.  So I had to look it up:  
  
-----  
  
I found one example of a study claiming that [""Professors who self-identify as Marxists outnumber professors who identify as conservatives.""](https://www.aei.org/events/the-close-minded-campus-the-stifling-of-ideas-in-american-universities/)  
  
Saying:  
  
&gt;“Among undergraduates, for example,” said Shields, “the politics of undergraduates is among the best predictors of their major. So, conservatives tend to gravitate into the natural sciences or into economics, and liberals tend to gravitate toward the humanities and social sciences.”

&gt;About 18 percent of social scientists in the United States self-identify as Marxists, compared to only about 5 percent who identify as conservatives, Dunn and Shields reported.  
  
The ""study"" (I couldn't find a link to the actual study, just a claim that the study was conducted) was performed by the American Enterprise Institute, a far-right, free-market think tank, largely funded by business and financial donors for the advancement of business and financial interests.  It was brought up during a discussion about the drawbacks of political correctness on college campuses.  So it's a far-right think tank advocating for far-right policy positions to advance far-right interests complaining about a ""far-left"" education system, while offering no proof.  
  
[Their positions on education are somewhat biased, to say the least.](https://www.aei.org/policy/education/)


[The American Enterprise Institute are also loudly outspoken in their opposition to any sort of legislation aimed at stopping or slowing climate change.](https://www.aei.org/tag/climate-change/)  
  
TL;DR: *If* a study exists, it was performed by a group who already knew the results beforehand. 
  
-------  

We've already seen how Conservatives react to things like ""safe spaces"" on campuses, and how severely they overreact to idiot college kids doing idiot college kid things, it's not a stretch to imagine them taking their concerns out on the teachers.  

##""Well where do these idiot college kids get the notion of 'political correctness' anyway?  *From their teachers!*  The only way to stop the spread of dangerous 'trigger warnings' and 'black lives' is by purging the SJWs and feminists from the universities!""  
  
Hell, the American Enterprise Institute is already claiming that ""Marxist professors outnumber Conservatives,"" how long is it before our free market President, Congress, Senate, and Supreme Court decide that 'marxist' professors are a real problem to American exceptionalism (or whatever)?  
  
I can see it happening, McCarthyism wasn't that long ago, after all."

heres the problem: you and the rest of the people opposing trump have cried wolf so many times that I have a hard time even taking your concerns seriously.

but i'll take a look. lets look at your post point by point:

&gt; zero relevant experience

objectively he is good at strategy, even though you may not agree with his beliefs. He was the strategic mind that brought Breitbart from an unknown news agency a few years ago to being a household name. that is effective strategy. He also was one of the chief strategists of Trump's campaign, which won against all odds. So again, looks like he is objectively good at strategy.

&gt; is in no way qualified to take the place of the Joint Chiefs of Staff who represent decades of experience, and the entire US Armed Forces and Intelligence Community.

take the place of? they will still attend the meetings. have you read the executive order outlining how everything is going to be structured? perhaps you should. You're panicking because trump has added an additional adviser to the counsel. 

&gt; No president in our history has ever done this. 

so what? this is literally a non issue. I mean, that is a stupid argument. No president in our history had ever had a department of homeland security but Bush 2 created one during his term. There is a first time for everything.

&gt; Did I mention that this is the National Security Council and this guy has openly stated he wants to destroy the country?

yeah, just like everything trump has done is ""literally hitler"". You guys have cried wolf too many times and your extreme hyperbole about everything has dulled your impact. so why should we trust you this time? 

&gt; We're the facts guys.

well, nothing in your post had anything to do with facts and was pretty much just an appeal to emotion, so.... yeah.

anyways, pull up some objective reasons why I should be concerned and i'll listen, but so far i'm not even convinced this is something to worry about.

So far, Putin hasn't said anything bad about Trump - only calling him 'colorful' (which Trump's translation read as 'brilliant' but nevermind that for now). Meanwhile Trump sees Putin as the type of leader *he'd* like to be - he has total control over his country, he's hyper-masculine, and very, very rich.

So for Trump's high-school-level social awareness, the dream is for Putin to recognise Trump as being one of his peers. Trump seriously wants that, possibly more than anything.

So Trump is highly motivated not to speak badly about Putin - not because of some corruption, or blackmail, but merely because he's got a child's understanding of leadership, and his bizarrely-twisted ego sees recognition from Putin as the ultimate achievement.

At the same time, he's got no problem slandering anyone and everyone in his own country who doesn't worship him like an emperor - and at the moment, that's just about everyone important.

I think the entire bizarre Trump/Putin dynamic is explained by his psychological makeup, his narcissism, and his intense insecurity. Could it be blackmail? Possibly. But that's not necessary to explain his behavior."

A strongman makes promises about law and order.

He may or may not be pissed off by every slight and respond but rest assured that the term strongman simply connotes someone who wants to have a lot of power precisely because he is thin skinned and a megalomaniac.

That, to me, seems entirely in favor of the large corporations, and not for the middle class. Especially for small business, who don't necessarily have the means to move overseas or ship in H1B foreign workers like large corporations have the benefit of. Which contributes to the increasing difficultly in competing with the products and services of large corporations outsourcing labor.

68853,0,"&gt;I meant specifically that the replacement should be someone who the public can trust to address their concerns and give them hope for the future. See this post.

Most of that post is about how terrible Trump supporters would feel if their candidate didn't get in. But again, it's hard to feel sympathy when Trump supporters are also ignoring the popular vote because the electoral college doesn't quite work that way. Like I said, it's hypocritical to get mad if the electoral college then goes and puts another person into office.

The poll you linked to was done almost a month ago, before he started appointing people to positions and before he confirmed that he wouldn't prosecute Hillary Clinton which turned into a sore spot for quite a few of his supporters. And did you see the sample size? 1003 people? Really? And the polls all said Hillary would win and we all see how that turned out.

But then we're not looking at the other side of the coin. You point out that,

&gt;Following Trump's victory, the majority of the public thinks Trump will improve the economy and half think he will reduce government corruption. An overwhelming majority of Trump voters say they feel ""hopeful"" and ""proud"". It is believed that for those people, Trump has replaced their anger with hope.

But what did his victory do to Hillary Clinton voters other than replace *their* hope with fear? I'm trans and if Obamacare goes, I lose my health coverage. Most of our civil rights have only gone through because of executive orders. The day after election night was terrifying because I got to see all the progress that was made for people like me vanish in an instant.

And this part if just weird:
&gt;Trump supporters (if not the public at large) need a candidate who will address the concerns they are the most angry about.

For a majority of voters, Trump is the concern they're angry about.

We have four major options:
*The electors vote Trump into office but Russia gets the satisfaction that they can mess with American politics without consequence.
*We remove the electoral college results and go with the popular vote and make Hillary Clinton president but also change the rules in the middle of the game.
*The electors don't give either of them enough electoral votes, put up a third candidate, and let the house vote them in, but put a person in the White House who received no votes but is still Constitutionally eligible.
*Hold another election but have to go through all of this madness again with the White House basically in limbo.

That's it. Nobody gets to be comfortable right now. Nobody gets to be picky. It's out of the hands of the American people. I'm not saying what we should do and who we should put into office because neither you nor I get a say right now. So I'll tell you what I told myself on November 9th:

569354,0,"Sure thing, bro.

&gt; I debate a lot of incompetent women that think they know what they're talking about myself.

Let's set aside the poor grammatical structure of the sentence for just a second and focus on the ability of this statement to be factual. 

You claim that these women are incompetent but since you're just relating your perception of an experience, it's no more ""factual"" than when you tell your friend ""I met this girl at the coffee shop and she totally wanted to fuck me."" You're just being a braggadocious dick. 

Further, the only evidence that we have is the sentence you make your non-factual claim, which serves to call into question your judgement of whether they are incompetent. So let's look at the sentence in which you call into question other people's competence:

First your structure terrible. Your English teacher would probably ask you to rewrite it as: ""I, myself, debate a lot of incompetent women that think they know what they're talking about."" Or maybe just ""I've debated many incompetent women that think they know what they're talking about.""  Your structure leads one to believe that you, yourself, are the incompetent one. Going back to the coffee shop analogy, if it turns out you are an poorly dressed fat nerd, it makes it harder to believe your non-factual claim.

Second, the structure of your comment doesn't make sense in the context of the conversation. Your sentax makes it sound like you're agreeing with the chain, but your comment is partially disagreeing, and a bit of a non-sequitur.  In coffee shop land, it would be like you quoting the girl you claim wants to fuck you as saying to you, ""I know we've never met, but I need your D in me right now,"" and saying that you replied ""I get that a lot, but I have homework to do."" You come off as a huge bullshitter. 

Hope that helps."

&gt; Does it power on?

Aye. If memory serves at one point when you powered it on it would say “*Baywatch* will be right back!” and then go into a comatose state. It's been a while since I gave it a shot, so I can't remember if it still does that, but some light definitely come on and you can definitely hear the amp power up.

We have the service manual too.

&gt; Once they are working it is usually just small items that are relatively easy to fix.

That's my thought too, because the thing was working at one point, and then it stopped. Between now and then it wasn't moved or jostled, nor was it subjected to any weird electrical jolts.

My current hypothesis is that it's doing a power-on self-test and it's detecting that the two rubber bumpers for the pieces near the flippers have busted, and it's going into a self-protection mode.

During that brief period of time we were going in the right direction, it may not have been perfect but it was getting there. It however does prove that it is possible, as long as the lower classes have enough countervailing power and there is enough social mobility where no person is unable to make more money if they want to.
