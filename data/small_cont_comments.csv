Because this country is based on a lose confederation of states that developed a robust and powerful centralized federal republic over time. When we federalized we didn't abolish state sovereignty and transform them into counties, districts, etc. It was the greatest compromise that allowed our county to be unified, and that compromise still had to be tested with bloodshed.

The Electoral College is far from a perfect system, but it is the best system we could create given the context of our nation's founding. The same issues people have with the Electoral College can also be applied to to the U.S. Senate, too, yet people don't decry the Senate as the bane of democracy."

That's literally not the discussion we are having. You sound like a nationalist.

They hacked a corrupt organization and revealed their corruption.

Our constitution is about our government. I don't know how you got confused, but Russian hackers hacking a US organization is not a sacrifice of our right to privacy. It's not something that is legal to begin with, obviously, as its a hack. What is a sacrifice of our right to privacy is when OUR OWN government makes privacy violations the standard procedure.

375162,0,"&gt;&gt;I'm saying that Sanders supporters need to turn out for their candidate to win an election

&gt;Gotcha. I thought you were insisting that *Sanders supporters* were to blame because they didn't turn out for *Clinton*.

&gt;Clinton has not made any public statements since her concession speech, while Sanders has not only urged the DNC to nominate Keith Ellison as the new chairman, but he's been issuing press releases and op-eds that dictate the future of the party. He's also pressing Chuck Schumer to give him a significant minority leadership role in the Senate. Essentially, he's the one pulling the most strings to clean up the party, re-orient it toward actual progressivism, while Clinton sulks in her post-defeat secrecy.  This runs counter to your hysterical narrative that Sanders and his supporters refuse to improve the party or learn from mistakes. Clinton is the one guilty of this, despite your attempt to spin it otherwise.

Whether Sanders and his supporters learned from their mistakes remains to be seen since most the candidates that Sanders supported lost their elections quote handily.

The circular firing squad from the left is not free of its share of Sanders supporters. Why didn't millenials turn out in the primary or the general?"

Just to be clear, your sole counterargument to the fact that constitutional scholars (from all political leanings) near unanimously disagree with your position is that NLRB specifically addressed temporary recess appointments? Your answer is not only nonresponsive, it is entirely nonsensical. Just as the recess appointment power exists, so too does the absolute and unwaivable requirement that the President appoint Justices **only** with the advise and consent of the Senate.

Because of course people don't really object or even care about solely theoretical constructions.  But when you look at public policy recommendations made using economic arguments and they are all typically bad it does damage the credibility of the field as a whole.

Either more economics need to speak out against those bad policy recommendations or perhaps, if economists are making recommendations that aren't supported by the theory they should stop doing so. Of course if they regularly do that it does mean I am correct that the predictions of economists should not be trusted.

Furthermore the legal definitions of rape in Sweden are far broader than elsewhere, resulting on various sexual assault or harassment incidences to be recorded under the rape definition. In the end their measure completely different than ours and cannot be compared against each other to make a judgement on which country is worse off.

404521,0,"Maybe not the Senate, but I really wouldn't rule out a House takeover if the GOP overreaches and Trump remains unpopular. Donald has the same approval ratings as Bush did in 2006, and it cost Republicans everything. Midterms are basically referrendums on the party holding the White House. Contrary to popular belief, there are enough competitive seats, and a wave can make a lot of places competitive that might not have been before.

Personally I think there is plenty of reason for a backlash besides the massively low approval ratings. If you go by history alone, America will probably get *some* sort of recession before 2020. Republicans intend to repeal ObamaCare immediately, which means 22 million people lose insurance at least before 2020. Massive tax breaks for the wealthy and corporate deregulation, along with an admin. stuffed full of bankers and insiders will look *awful* to Trump's supporters who expected a swamp draining.

Most of all, when Trump doesn't fulfill so many of those fanciful promises and jobs don't begin materializing out of thin air a year or two from now, people will turn on him just like they do with every president who promises too much and gets their hopes up too high.

Even if we don't get it back by 2018, it seems highly likely Republicans are swept out up and downballot by at least 2020."

So, where does that lead to ?  good question, I heard this last night on one of the news shows, and it provides a good clue as to why Comey took the action.  If HRC winds the election, he has to go to Lynch with that special prosecutor required now message, and even he washes his hands from the investigation, the Obama admin transitions to HRC (who is under investigation via the special prosecutor), and Comey is retained as FBI head until they confirm HRC's appointment.  As such, it makes sense that Comey went public now, knowing that his path was to ensure a special prosecutor was appointed pre-HRC administration.

All I am doing is pointing out how incredibly subjective the standard you have proposed is. The reason you have created such a subjective standard is because Obama's treatment of Fox News satisfied the objective standard you initially proposed. This forced you to change the standard to try and excuse what Obama did, but still claim Trump is a threat to Democracy.

&gt; Because ""first step towards authoritarianism"" is how Chris Wallace portrayed it (agreeing with John McCain that this is ""how dictators get started"")

Yeah. I disagree with those two.

The ""real"" hippies I've met are festival tour folk - Rainbow types etc., you know what I'm talking about. The psychedelic mindset is in such contrast to capitalist and modern social ideals that the difficulties with re-integration you're describing happen all the time. I think there's a *lot* of spiritual value in the ""hippy/spirit science"" lifestyle and culture and many people could learn a thing or two about themselves and the world if they'd be open to disconnecting and having experiences like you did. That idealism and yearn to reconnect with nature is IMO an existential drive inside all of us, even in those where it's been suppressed beyond recognition. Don't reject the experiences and struggles you've had and look at conformation with society as being pragmatic as opposed to virtuous. If you let the psychedelic wonder and ideals of spiritual connectedness inspire your actions and behavior towards other your contribution to society will be far greater than that of many. Cherish your suffering. Financial troubles, failed relationships and bad trips can be rough but they're nothing if not educational. Stay open to learning about yourself and feelings and don't close the blinders with hard drugs like opiates. Let the immediate sensation of being ""connected to the universe on another level"" fade but have faith in its truth and keep it close to your heart. It's good to be critical but stay mindful, try to live in the moment and don't judge yourself to the point of shame.

342496,0,"&gt;Buybacks: the company takes money from its own cash box and buys the pieces of paper back from the existing investors. Where is the waste?

Yes, I know precisely how they work. The ""waste"" is in company profits going towards propping up stock prices rather than investments elsewhere and job creation. We're going down a much different tangent here though.

&gt;Stock options: they're pieces of paper (options), which are given to existing employees and they can exchange them for other pieces of paper (stocks) at some later point in time, which they may or may not be able to liquidate for cash at some later point. Where is the waste?

I never said there was waste in stock options.

&gt;There are 28 million businesses in the US and 543,000 new businesses get started each month, it's really not that rare...

They start businesses, yes. But many of those also fail. Success is dependent on consumers buying those products, which drives 70% of the economy. You seemed to have overlooked that in my last comment.

&gt;What would they do with all the money in the world? :) You seem to think that when a business takes in cash, it just sits there. And there are 28 million examples of that not being the case, and 543K new examples each month of that not being the case! So where is the waste and how is government going to be better at it?

There's 1.4 trillion examples of it being the case. Hyperbole aside, companies sometimes DO just sit on cash. http://money.cnn.com/2015/03/20/investing/stocks-companies-record-cash-level-oil/

Second, I didn't say government is going to be better at this. I am not arguing against free enterprise, I'm arguing against trickle down economics. These are two distinctly and not mutually exclusive concepts.

&gt;No... no, I never said that it can simply disappear! I have demonstrated quite the opposite, it never disappears! There is no black hole for cash, unless you burn it of course, but that only makes everybody else's money more valuable.

Yes, it can simply disappear. Stock prices are the current value of future cash flow. If these valuations change, and people sell at a lower price (because no one is willing to buy at current valuations), then these losses are realized, thereby essentially disappearing.

&gt;No it didn't... the amount of USD in circulation is roughly $1.2 trillion, so I have no clue how you think we can lose trillions of USD, when we only have $1.2 trillion. :)

Dude, really? You lecture me on giving out free econ lessons now this? Seriously? There's loads more to the economy than just cash in circulation. [Quick google search](http://www.businessinsider.com/2009/2/america-lost-102-trillion-of-wealth-in-2008) tells me over $10 trillion in value was lost in 2008 via market crash and home equity losses. I'm not even going to get into the trillions in commercial paper that was floating around. And these losses were REAL. They affected people's investments and 401(k)s. Loads of people dependent on markets to grow got screwed over in the market crash and had to keep working.

We are getting side-tracked here though. My primary argument is against trickle down economics. I'm not saying government is better than free enterprise. I'm only saying that tax breaks to poor and middle class drive the economy more than tax breaks to the wealthy :)"

906239,0,"&gt;I'd argue the greater potential for mass-destruction in such a large space in a short amount of time is what makes it banworthy. 1% isn't any better of an argument than asserting the atomic bomb should be legalized because historically it's killed less than 1% of human beings in war.

Is this like the Godwin's law of a weapons debate? You're seriously comparing a semi automatic rifle to a nuclear weapon? Not only is the difference in absolute scale absurd, the relative difference between a conventional bomb and a nuclear weapon is thousands or millions of times as powerful and presents an existential threat to humanity.

Compare that to the difference between an ""assault weapon"" and another semi automatic rifle in destructive potential: **literally zero**. Because they do not operate differently

&gt;Calling it assault weapon, rather than just assault rifle, prevents people from skirting the ban by labelling it something else like ""assault shooter."" Assault weapon is a generally understood term.

This might be one of the most ignorant paragraphs I could imagine reading on this topic. Let's break this down: first of all, an assault weapon is *not* an assault rifle. It is clearly not a generally understood term, because you do not understand it. There is nothing that is ""just"" an assault rifle that would be covered by the AWB that is not covered by laws on things that are *actually assault rifles*.

Assault weapon legislation does nothing to deal with skirting bans on weapons, because (most) gun legislation is based on *how a gun operates* not what it is called. Because most gun legislation isn't pants on head idiotic. Most gun legislation with the notable exception of assault weapons bans, which **do not do care how a gun operates**, but entirely are based on what its exterior shell looks like.

The AWB does not regulate assault rifles, the National Firearms Act does, as it has been regulating machine guns since **1934**. Assault rifles are a type of machine gun, they are defined by their action and ammunition. ""Assault weapons"" are a type of semi automatic rifle (and some pistols), they are defined by *what they look like*.

The term ""assault weapon"" is intended to confuse and succeeds very well at it. Case in point: the terminology has succeeded in completely confused you and led you to support what you think is a ban on something that is actually already banned, but actually bans something completely different."

When gas prices were nearing $4 per gallon, they couldn't keep the more fuel efficient vehicles on the lots while it took a fire sale to move the trucks and SUVs.  This also resulted in an influx of subprime auto loans as people traded in their new-ish trucks and SUVs on smaller vehicles like the Cobalt and Vibe then rolled the remaining balance over into the new car loan.  

Speaking as a former GM employee, they are only doing this to boost profits in the short term.  The profit margin on the trucks and SUVs is much higher than it is for smaller vehicles like the Cruz and Verano.  On the larger trucks and SUVs, GM typically turns a $9,000 to $15,000 profit per vehicle, while the smaller more efficient vehicles they are lucky to turn a $2,000 profit, and sometimes even lose money on them."

That was my whole mentality for picking ""conservative"". I had full respect of my Democrat brethren (and in reality, we're all basically Independents and Moderates, but I digress).

My insight into many of the Democratic views at the time was that people voted more emotionally and without seeing what the effects of their choices could impact. I felt that ""Liberal"" views were basically ""pick X because it sounds right"" and never take the time to consider that 1 right thing could cause a dozen unforeseen worse things.

When I got older, I realized everything is broken, neither party matters at all, people treat their political parties like shitty sports teams, and will support their ""color"" for no reason (just to see the other side ""lose"").

I wish everyone could drop political parties altogether and just vote on individuals. The 2 party system is just a way to control votes and make the people THINK they have a voice in politics."

While systems of this kind are the pop cultural go-to-examples for dictatorships, those are actually pretty rare... in the 20th century, authoritarians outnumbered totalitarians at least by a ratio of 10:1.

Bernie had a base that he couldn't expand on. Voter registration issues? You mean the rules in place in places like New York where you have to register with the party before you can vote in the primary? Seems like a ground game making sure voters understood that would be useful. Did Sanders have that? Well, not really. The rest of your rant is undocumented simplifications and demonized hyperbole. 

What Sanders did is impressive, lets not get that confused. But, he announced too late, did not have the money, ground game, or rhetoric to get elected. What he did have was an idealist message, and an untarnished character. That makes him very appealing to us young'ins. But you need to understand: In our system and in this climate their was no way in hell Sanders would get elected.

These attacks are aimed not only at Americans but at the heart of what it means to be an American, Clinton said, adding, ""Now, I guess we shouldn’t be too surprised. This is the same guy who said he thought the Emmys were rigged against him. But this is serious. On January 20th, the first thing a president does is to take an oath to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution.

2. 
&gt;Even though she is supposed to be neutral, she signs the royal assents and sets the govt policy. 

She signs any royal assent that is put before her, whatever she might personally think. That's what being neutral is.  
She does NOT set government policy. The speech is written by the Prime Minister and the monarch is not allowed to change it. The last one to try and add something was Edward VII, who (in the words of David Starkey) got ""firmly slapped down"".

You can't dissolve the House of Lords. Also, prorogation is simply the start of the summer break, before the state opening later in the year.  
With the Fixed-Term Parliament Act 2011, parliament can't be dissolved by the Prime Minister (speaking through the Queen) anymore.

Look, all these ""secret powers"" (which are so secret you can look them up on Wikipedia, or various British gov't websites) are the monarch's *only on paper*. They are exercised on the advice of the government. This works because the British give various habits and conventions the status of constitutional law. No reason to get so worked up about ""secret powers"" and imagining some cabal of royal flunkies ruling Britain from behind the scenes. If you don't like the institution of monarchy, fine.

It doesn't for all things. However, it could lead to less total ""smog"" since people walk more (though it's counter-intuitive, since smog tends to be an ""urban"" thing, but that's because it's concentrated, not more of it). It would presumably lead to less loss of native habitats. Ground contamination would be limited, as would ""urban heat island effect"" (which like smog, happens to be concentrated enough to notice). And there's going to be greater efficiency, such as using larger power plants, mass transit or having better recycling programs.

As devil's advocate.... Cities are almost always on large bodies of waters (typically either are coastal or drain to the ocean), so urbanization could lead to more water pollution and trash in the oceans.

It depends on what you think is the ""worst"". Personally, I tend to automatically rank things in regards to ""global warming"", such that pollution in one lake is less bad than an equal amount of atmospheric pollution. If you have different priorities, it may be urbanization is worse. In general, it should lead to less pollutants of *most* types."

You seem to have a really strong opposition to the idea of ""white privilege"" existing.  Or perhaps more specifically, you feel as if because of your skin color, there is an element of reverse racism.  

In some ways, I agree with your sentiment.  As a white male myself, its frustrating that I feel like my opinion or voice can be disregarded by those when trying to have a conversation about race in this country.  The narrative often follows that you need to allow those POC to have a space to vent their racial or prejudicial grievances without those of the oppressive race in the conversation.  While you might perceive this as marginalizing and labelling you by skin color, I find that this is merely an expression of someone else's cultural or race and airing grievances, which I feel like we should be supportive of.  

Yes, it is perfectly okay to be frustrated with being labelled a racist or prejudiced by your skin color. That is not okay. It is still okay to admit that certain institutional history and structure of our country and say ""Yes, the judicial system was set up to hurt those of color more than white people. Yes, that system was created by an oppressive white culture of old.""  I think it's okay to learn from mistakes and it is okay for those to call out past grievances, but where I think we can both agree is that trying to label all white people as ""part of the problem"" is ONLY a flaw when we those white folks (including myself) try to deny that the systems we have in place are inherently racist."

136731,0,"&gt; I am not suggesting any search should be done without a warrant. I am saying if there was probable cause to review your email correspondence that resulted in a search warrant

Which is why the limits of that warrant *matter*.

If you have a warrant to search for a loaded shotgun in my house, and stumble on a small box labeled ""letters"", you don't get to open it. Your search of ""my house"" doesn't inherently include the entire thing or everything inside of it, only what could be fruitful to the specific search you are authorized for.

If you *do* open that box, the effect is the same as if you had no warrant at all.

&gt; it strikes me in no way as a violation of one's constitutional rights to manually review header information as a means of ascertaining those communicating in emails

First, remember that there are two potential targets of the search. And second that a warrant must specify the limits of the search.

Second, remember that exceeding the limits of a warrant means you are searching without a warrant.

Was there a search warrant to review Abedin's emails prior to them looking at the headers? It depends on the limits of the warrant for Weiner's.

&gt;In serving a criminal search warrant, when is outside counsel called in to conduct the search instead of law enforcement

I'm not sure if there have been any significant number of cases, but it's the easiest way to ensure that Abedin's rights were preserved while allowing the search.

&gt;Without knowing all of a suspect's email addresses, how can an algorithm clearly delineate emails intended for a suspect versus another individual?

This entire election cycle is looking like one big example of anti-democratic, anti-US subversive activities being played out within our country, on TV and in front of everyone no less.

We could be witnessing a campaign to undermine the stability of the US being perpetrated by foreigners (like the Saudis who donate so much to the Clintons and who barely try to hide their disdain for Americans and ""infidls""), meanwhile the rich folks here in the west are virtually trying to overthrow our entire legal system themselves, using ""treaties"" like the TPP which will supersede national law."

For example, If this happens during Trump's presidency, you can count on Russia to back trump's regime, but France, Britain, Australia and Germany could potentially back the revolution. I see China being more opportunistic, so they could go either way.  

Unfortunately, that does leave US soil as the center of essentially a world war, but in this day and age, I could see a long stand-off, military posturing, a few skirmishes and ultimately a diplomatic resolution.

Are her words really that valuable? Or are they....getting something else out of it. Occam's razor and all that


&gt;2. Does the intelligence community believe that Hilary's wealth is due to insider connections with Russian industries and government?

They certainly don't think that's where the bulk of trumps wealth comes from. But there is something to be pointed out when people claim it's ""dangerous"" that certain countries (like russia) possibly helped trump (by releasing the truth....)

And yet these same people were supporting a candidate that was OPENLY being helped by Saudi Arabia and other ""problematic"" sources

How is it a danger when one does it but ignored when the other does it?

The partisanship is hard to avoid until the people going after trump admit their candidate was just as bad if not worse 


&gt;3. Does this need to be a partisan issue or can we focus on the current president-elect, not the one who lost?

It absolutely has to be a partisan issue when there are people actively campaigning for the electoral college to change the results (if only to another republican)

If people honestly believe russia strongly influenced the election (unlike fbi director James Comey and the NSA) then that's something people should take time to look at and possibly see what can be done to avoid this happening in future elections (though your best bet is simply not to run the most corrupt candidate of all time)

But if you truly want this to be a non-partisan issue you need to accept that Donald Trump *will* be the 45th President of the United States and nothing will change that.

All talks of investigating outside influences, auditing voting procedures or whatever else you have in mind should be *looking ahead* to 2018 or 2020

But as long as your goal is to block or undermine President Trump, it is a partisan issue.

Because one side wants him to be President and the other doesn't. How can we be non-partisan on that issue when we're so divided on it?

It's worth noting also that the Russian allegations didn't just come out of nowhere after the election. It's not like the general public had no clue that it was a possibility when they voted on November 8

On the contrary, Hillary and the dems had been accusing Russia of being involved and accused Trump of being buddies with Putin for months
Hillary even mentioned it multiple times during the debates and flat out said Russians hacked the dnc (which brought on trumps infamous ""it could be a 400lb man in his basement"" line)

In other words the voters knew this was a possibility and voted for Trump anyway

The people who are begging the EC to block Trump are acting like if only the voters knew they wouldn't have voted trump but this had been out there for months, at least as a possibility"

Well this is true, but misleading. Both had favorability ratings that are affected by the country being polarized. Hillary had high favorability ratings with Democrats, but it was dragged down by half the nation being Republican, vice versa with Trump. 

&gt;and you can't say the majority of the country wanted either candidate when a small fraction of the country voted and they voted under the rules of the electoral college. 

Turnout is always low because of apathy and voter suppression. She still won the popular vote aka the majority.

I would very much like numbers on how many of these illegal immigrants and migrants have committed crimes vs. American born citzens.

It's better for everyone in the community if they have one less person to support through charitable giving (y'know like welfare or other services does in this country).

Then tell them to keep their legs together!

&gt;This principle holds true in developed nations too, like ours. A woman that is able to better control her reproductive cycle is less likely to require government assistance and hand-outs, which in turn makes government more efficient and smaller.

Or we can just stop rewarding those bad behaving women with money! Let them be the example of what happens when you are irresponsible! Then we have a small handful of children in poverty instead of twenty times more!


&gt;I think we can agree that outcome is what everyone wants from their government.

Well, I'm not very selfish. I dont see the govt as a tool to rob my neighbors for free shit I think I'm entitled too. So I want govt severely restricted compared to what it is today.

This was the precise moment where Clinton lost.  From then on, support for trump rose in key states, at the cost of support for Libertarian Gary Johnson.  It was Johnson's candidacy that was keeping trump away from securing those key states up to then.  He split the right. 

So yes, Libertarian Gary Johnson sabotaged his own campaign so that trump and his many libertarian-esque policies could go forward and win.  This incident, combined with his other gaffes, did it.  

Further, corporate-controlled MSM, who at the end of the day didn't want Clinton, Sanders, or Warren and their policies near real power, were more than happy to plaster that wagging tongue on every outlet imaginable.

The Democratic party forgot that she isn't just disliked, she is *loathed*. She has been hated by a substantial portion of the country since the early 90's.

Why should government agencies necessarily operate ""lean and mean?"" More specifically, what should the definition of ""lean and mean"" look like with respect to a government agency?

&gt; Putting ""the squeeze"" on the agencies will allow them to prioritize their work to do the most ""good"" or ""impactful"" things with limited resources.

Is that actually the case? For instance, I'm a scientist in a field with close partnerships between academia, industry, and the public sector. In particular, I do a lot of collaborating with scientists at federal labs funded by NOAA, the DoE, and NASA. I've *never* heard of a federally-employed scientist complaining of ""abundant"" resources. It's always penny-pinching nine ways to Sunday. They're *already* doing great science on budgets which barely support them. I doubt that putting the squeeze on them will do anything except *decrease* productivity.

13743,0,"&gt;Nations printing money has adverse consequences in a global economy. I do hope you weren't suggesting that could be the solution for millennials when all the older generations die off -- it isn't. You need to educate yourself on national and global economics if you actually believe that.

Of course there are adverse consequences.  If there were not, then everyone would just print away their debt.  

But it's still always an option on the proverbial table.  As are defaults, haircuts, and the like.  None of these are painless and would probably undermine the economic order, which is a huge downside not only for us but the world.  Heck, the government may be forced to go back on the gold standard to restore confidence, which would suck during recessions/depressions.  

Also, I've read a lot on economics, especially historical economics.  I, for example, know that given enough time the expected value of any fiat currency is the material it is made out of.  No government lasts forever.  I also know about our relative debt/GDP ratios, although we're a bit on the high side (higher than Germany, around what UK and France are running, and certainly not as high as Japan).  

However, my pushback is on the concept that sovereign debt is destiny.  It's not.  Indeed that concept is actually a problem on the right because some think if they run up the debt, they'll force everyone to accept they can't have a safety net.  People don't tend to work that way.   

Sorry, no time for the other stuff.  Just addressing one of my pet peeves about the fallacy that is Starve the Beast.  I'm actually a big fan of running sensible debt-to-GDP ratios and think this line of reasoning, that the nation is like any ordinary creditor, is actually causing some really stupid reasoning by some of our more radical citizens.  I think how California is tackling debt is probably the way to go -- during good times you pay down the debt to keep your options open and during bad times you don't freak out about debt too much and hope the bond markets don't cut you off.  But if the other side is going to trying to act like economic terrorists then it's important to understand everyone's real leverage.  If they think that people are going to choose Bretton Woods over Social Security, they are fools."

Can I believe, as the article suggests, that some protestors were rigging propane tanks for god knows what purpose, something went wrong, and they're willing to lie about that for media attention or actually *believe* the police were somehow at fault? Yep.

Many supporters don't even seem to properly understand the issues. The pipeline doesn't cross the Standing Rock reservation, just a nearby river, and it's pretty much impossible to run a pipeline from North Dakota to Illinois without crossing some major rivers. Just looking at a map it looks all but impossible to build an oil pipeline from North Dakota to Illinois that doesn't cross some major rivers *upstream of a major Native American reservation*. So the idea that the pipeline can't be allowed on this route seems silly. The question is, is it reasonably well-designed, did it go through the appropriate processes, does it appear to be reasonably safe, and is there some sort of malfeasance going on here? There was extensive litigation surrounding this pipeline, and courts did not side with the anti-pipeline forces. Courts aren't the end-all be-all of what's right, but given that the tribe had their day in court, I feel like there's a bit of a burden of proof for the tribe/protestors to present a cogent argument that there's been malfeasance or a miscarriage of justice.

The whole situation is... kind of complicated. [For instance:](http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/21/us/dakota-access-pipeline-protests/)

&gt;Police and about 400 people who were protesting the Dakota Access Pipeline clashed Sunday evening as demonstrators set fires and law enforcement officers fired rubber bullets, tear gas and water at the crowds, authorities said.

Hmm, sounds like the police are being excessive, maybe?

&gt;Protesters were attempting to cross the Backwater Bridge and go north on Highway 1806, according to the Morton County Sheriff's Department, which described Sunday's events as a riot.

&gt;Law officers were there to keep protesters from crossing the bridge, which the sheriff's department said was closed for safety reasons ""due to damage caused after protesters set numerous fires"" on it in a separate incident on October 27.

If law enforcement has closed a bridge for safety reasons, and you're not literally trapped on an island or something as a result, it doesn't seem to me that you have the right to just try to bull your way through their line. You can walk up peacefully and demand they arrest you, you can find other ways or places to protest.

&gt;The coalition said protesters on Sunday were trying to remove one of two vehicles -- both burned in the October 27 incident -- from the bridge when authorities started firing the rubber bullets, tear gas and water.

&gt;The bridge's closure and the burned vehicles blocking it endanger residents to the south because it hinders easy access for any emergency vehicles coming from the north, the coalition says.

Um, kind of sounds like the protesters might have had something to do with those burned vehicles being on the bridge. Also, it's not their place to go clear those vehicles.

&gt;""There are multiple fires being set by protesters on the bridge and in the area of the bridge,"" said Donnell Hushka, another spokeswoman for the Morton County Sheriff's Department. ""We have fire trucks on the scene (and) they are using their fire hoses to put out the fires, wet the land around so fires don't spread and they are also using water as crowd control.""

&gt;Begay said there were ""peaceful bonfires"" around which protesters were gathering to keep warm. The coalition alleged that other fires were grass fires ignited by flares shot by law enforcement.

If I go start a bunch of ""peaceful bonfires"" on the land around a public highway/bridge with a significant police presence, I expect I'll get arrested. Frankly, I expect I committed some sort of crime, actually."

Yes.

**Does he care if you are gay or get married as a gay couple?**
 
Nope.

**Universal healthcare?**

 Seems to be what he's suggesting.

**Gun Control?**

I'd say requiring people to get certified and trained just to touch a gun qualifies. So check...

**Immigration**

Seems to have the typical democrat approach. Provide a pathway, but don't completely tolerate illegal immigration. 

**For the Wars?**

Nope.

**Education**

Fund it more...

**Drug War**

End it.

**Marijuana**

For it (if you extrapolate both his 'if you aren't harming anyone whatever' and anti-drug war stance).

**Corporate regulations**

The larger the company, the more regulations it needs. So check...

It seems like the conservative issues are the exceptions, not his liberal positions. These claims of him being conservative don't live up to scrutiny. You are judging him by his party, not his ideas."

392435,0,"&gt; You think this agreement has a net positive economic effect for China?

Only if America and India are also in the same agreement. It's a net reduction for everyone besides the one that makes the most profit on selling the renewable energy or the technology/parts/etc, and that would be China. Also China and India have a lot more to gain from reducing pollution because it would give a huge quality of life improvement in their cities. Comparatively America has less to gain.

My entire point is that they, as in any of those 3 countries, don't give a shit about global warming because it would affect their bottom line. If everyone hurts the same they don't mind as much because it doesn't put them at a disadvantage. Any time those countries talk about it it's purely done because of politics.

&gt;&gt; Summing up, the authors concluded there is “a systematic and large gap between the US economy’s performance when a Democrat is President of the United States versus when a Republican is. Democrats do better on almost every criteria.”
Or as one of the authors, Watson, told us in a phone interview, the difference is “large and statistically significant, regardless of how you look at it.”

&gt;&gt; “The superiority of economic performance under Democrats rather than Republicans is nearly ubiquitous; it holds almost regardless of how you define success,” the authors stated in their report. “By many measures, the performance gap is startlingly large — so large, in fact, that it strains credulity, given how little influence over the economy most economists (or the Constitution, for that matter) assign to the President of the United States.”

&gt;&gt; The authors said the evidence for better economic performance under Democrats remained even when factoring in such variables as the majority party in Congress and whether Democrats inherited “superior initial conditions.”
So what was the reason for the gap?

Clinton would have had a landslide polling against trump back in July after the convention as well.

Lol.

Whatever dude. The U.S. will become more unstable as inequality increases, and inequality will increase with the  ""informed and educated"" decrease. That in turn will cause greater instability. You seem to claim that a government (an extreme minority of people)  can indefinitely enslave the majority despite ""instability"" of revolts.

Maybe you're right, but it hasn't happened. I admit that's begging the question.

&gt;It is possible that some states (e.g. Texas or California) may try to secede as the US start its backward slide, but its unlikely to be successful. Much as they may hate the reality, they do tend to be dependent on each other more than they may think.

Presumably, as the federal government requires to expend more resources on 1) Paying off the wealthy, and 2) Putting down uprisings, while workers become less and less productive, it would in turn be less capable of preventing more successful states from leaving, especially if it's one of the most wealthy (California, Texas, New York - in that order).

&gt;Much as they may hate the reality, they do tend to be dependent on each other more than they may think.

And as the entire country slips, the amount they are ""dependent"" in comparison to going their own way would decrease. (For instance, if you get 10% from being in the U.S., 10% of $1000 might be significant, but 10% of a buck fifty is a dime and a nickel.)"

&gt;&gt; Hungary’s far-right Jobbik party, which won 20% of the vote in parliamentary elections last April, is avowedly pro-Russian. In 2013 its leader described Russia as the guardian of Europe’s heritage, contrasting it with the “treacherous” EU. Its most controversial figure, Bela Kovacs, a member of the European Parliament, has lobbied on behalf of Russian interests and supported the invasion of Crimea. But Fidesz, Hungary’s ruling party, once fiercely anti-communist, has also been cultivating closer Russian ties. In July the prime minister, Viktor Orban, said he was striving to build “an illiberal state” within the EU.

Nothing sketchy there.

&gt;&gt; France’s National Front, the foremost right-nationalist party, openly admires Mr Putin. Its leader, Marine Le Pen, has made several trips to Moscow. It recently accepted a €9.4m ($10.6m) loan from First Czech Russian Bank, a lender with indirect links to the Kremlin. It is said to be the first tranche of a €40m loan (a huge sum for the party, if true). Ms Le Pen says it was turned away by Western banks.

Keep in mind if you're talking total taxes that also includes the rest of the Canadian social security net as well, including greatly reduced university tuition.

380078,0,"&gt; And as far as I know you couldn't escalate privilege with an email account into being able to access other users emails right?  

That's exactly how it works, you get into any account you can and then use that to pivot into other accounts or higher privileged accounts.  

Look up Token Impersonation and Privileged Escalation, two of the most common methods used.  There are other methods, I remember one time the inspection team used a view only account to a network monitoring tool to create their own admin accounts to the system.  From there they were able to use those local admin accounts to impersonate a domain admin account and... well, game over.  Took me a few hours to figure out how they did it (they just said we found the credentials for X account).  

&gt; As to the lowest employee account being as big a risk as an admin account, would just basic implementation of group and user rights prevent that from being an issue?  

Those help mitigate the risk and play a part in it, but things like token impersonation are still going to be possible.  There's a few extreme steps that can be taken to protect against it, such as rebooting a system every time the admin logs out (tokens stay on a computer, running Windows, until reboot).  There are also some event log entries you can monitor for (preferably with automated monitoring that sends alerts) but those can get spammy as there are legitimate uses for executing under another account.  But remember, her stuff was being run by a guy with security knowledge (at this point, you probably now know more than he did), he didn't even bother to get a simple SSL certificate for the first 3 months it was set up.

Getting into an admin account from the start always makes life easier, but the first step is getting in anyway you can.

680016,0,"&gt; Why don't you see adults being active? Why has adult activism always been smaller in numbers than students? 

Look any any political action committee, which is how change is made in this era, and you'll see that they're comprised of mostly Xers and boomers. Same with unions. Millennials aren't joining unions even when they're available to them. Activism isn't holding a sign or camping out (or making reddit posts), it's making change. What makes change? Organization. 

&gt;  Also, when you say people have more debt and work less hours, wouldn't that suggest that living conditions for debt holders has gone down?

By ""living conditions have gone down"" do you mean that quality of living has gotten worse? If so, then no. The average American workday is only 8.5 to 9 hours. That includes 30-60 minutes of an unpaid lunch break. The 10 hour number also factors in commute times. A decline in working hours has a direct correlation to an increase in quality of living. It gives people more time to pursue personal interests, to be social, and to have leisure time. The smaller the percentage of your life you have to dedicate to working, the higher your quality of living. That's always been the case. I only brought up the time because the argument seemed to be that debt = less time for activism, when in fact we now have more personal time today than in any previous era in American history."

I mean we could go further with regulating oil and demand better pipelines and capture more pollutants but it would be more expensive than its worth.

Welfare is also an economic calculation.  Is it better to let people fall into poverty or help them until their situation is better?  How much do you spend per person before we get diminished returns?

All I'm saying is that there has to be a balance to these things.  Getting rid of 11M people would be more expensive than it's worth but getting rid of criminal illegal immigrants is realistic.  We can probably remove more and do better at prevention but there's no way we get rid of all 11M *and* prevent all illegal immigration."

I agree with you in that it was accepted that there were WMDs in Iraq as fact which turned out to be false. After everything went down and the details about the CIA assessment over WMDs came out, it was one or a few officers who had flimsy evidence, the ""aluminum tubes,"" and that we fucking sold them WMDs, and carpet bombed those manufacturing plants in the early 90s. 
 
We were lied to by the government, yes. However, there was not as much consensus back then as there was over WMDs compared to Russia being involved in those email leaks. It's not just the government saying this either. There were half a dozen cyber security firms saying it as well. Just because we get something wrong the first time doesn't mean that every time they say something 13 years later is wrong. They were right about Osama being in Pakistan, they are right in the location of numerous terrorist targets as well. 
 
Just like you pointed out that there are caveats in what is widely accepted as true, it doesn't mean that Earth *doesn't* revolve around the sun.

It is entirely possible that the House may choose Trump and the Senate may choose Kaine.  Indeed, this may be LIKELY if the Senate goes blue.

If this occurs, Pence has no immediate future in the federal government.  If Trump were to be impeached (and removed) he'd be replaced by Kaine, not Pence.

Lastly, assuming the Senate stays Red, they could get Pence even faster.  All the Republicans would have to do is never conclude their selection of President.  If the Senate selects the VP and the House gets stuck in endless ballotting, the VP becomes ACTING President.  You'd not even need to impeach.  Pence could be president in January."

The other absurd thing is that people keep equating *voters in a state* with *that state*. Ignore the lines on the map. If more people want one candidate over another, why in the world would their locations matter in the slightest?

For example, there's a researcher that said recently -- and NYT covered it TWICE -- that black people are no more likely to be shot by police once the gun is out. Republicans loved it. OF course, the whole concept was nonsense dressed up by an ideologue misusing his academic credentials to pump up his reputation with the very conservative power establishment. LOL

In this case, it's not entirely at the end because at the very end it wouldn't look good. The very end is where women and men do equal work and women get something between 4 to 11 percent lower pay by all accounts -- including the conservative think tanks at the low end and actually scholarly reports at the high end.

Sine the very end would not support this notion that women are treated fairly, they have to back up just a tiny bit. They assume that women have full and equal opportunity to get into particular professions -- thus the misleading word ""choice."" With that, the technique is revealed.

Just like with the black person at the point of the gun, the question arises: How did the woman get to the point of winding up in that profession?"

He has successfully monetised his claims and his notoriety.

&gt; Stone is close to Alex Jones, the gravel voice behind the fringe-right web news outfit Infowars and a nationally syndicated radio show.

785191,0,"&gt;Let's put an actual number on this ""a large swath""

I'm not putting a number on anything. 

&gt;nationalism

Being proud of ones own country and wanting to see it thrive is not a bad thing.

&gt;religion-phobia

There is no Muslim ban.

&gt;border-closing

When was the border closed?

&gt;These are not ""imaginary bogeyman"" 

Yes they are. Trump wants to enforce our own laws. This does not make one a Nazi.


&gt;Even besides all this, there are literal Nazis that support Trump's policies. They self-identify as Nazis. 

There are self- identifying socialists on the left. Socialism has had a role in atrocities throughout history as well. Your point is?

&gt;And how in the world is that reactionary fringe any different from the RUSH of right-wingers that went out to buy ammo as soon as Obama was elected? 

People exercising their right to buy a product is not the same as people rioting in the streets. False equivalence, and another emotional appeal (guns bad!). 

We have a right to arm ourselves. We have a right to protest. We do not have a right to riot and assault. This is where the left lost the debate. And instead of apologizing for over reacting, or atoning, all I see are continued efforts to double down on more divisive and violent non-sense. Its why you lost. It will be why you continue to lose.

&gt;People are worried that gays are going to get thrown in camps because there are a shitload of people (read: millions and millions) in this country that think homosexuality is a crime. 

Trump is not one of these people. This statement sums up to ""people think a lot of thinks, therefore trump is bad."" Very intellectually dishonest.

&gt;What else do you do with criminals besides put them in camps? There's no delusion there: there's ample historical precedent.

This is delusion. I don't know what else you can call it when we have someone like Rachel Maddow--a very mainstream personality with millions of followers--openly suggesting Trump may throw gay people into camps despite his open support of LGBT causes.

People on the left are not thinking, they are reacting emotionally to every bad thing they have ever even *imagined* Trump doing. These people are not grounded in reality. They peddle propaganda that is often steeped in half-truths and total delusion. They appeal to emotion, not facts.

&gt;The immigration order was a Muslim ban, and you're terribly short-sighted if you think otherwise

It wasn't.

&gt;Here you go, December 2015, literally calling it a muslim ban

Difference between rhetoric and action. This is not how it ended up being enacted.

&gt;Even if he never used the phrasing for ""muslim ban"" (which he did), do you really think that's not what this is about? 

It's about securing our border and making sure we properly vet people coming from areas that are known for being volatile. 

&gt;Maybe you're right, it's not a Muslim ban

I am.

&gt;The right has Ayn Rand

And you want to talk about generalizations?

&gt;The right, on the other hand, thrives on emotion

Whats more emotional than beating people in airports and leaving them for dead in the streets? 

&gt;Again, the left has been thinking about this shit for a long, long time, and there's very good fully intellectualized and rational reasons for considering the swing of political ideology in this country to be a very, very bad thing for representative democracy, egalitarianism, and classical liberalism as a whole.

They've wasted a lot of time then, because the people rioting in the streets can't express these ideas without violence.


&gt;The left has thinkers

Clearly you are not one of them.

So health for 911 responders in the wake of 9/11 when everyone rallied around New York? David Duke could have passed that.

7364,0,"Taking advantage of available resources for their lowest possible price allows for the current American lifestyle. 

Also, China might decide to be a bit bolder in expanding their power (through land or militarily) if they get a tighter economic grip on Asia, leading to more competition between Asia and the US (and US allies such as Japan). This could be bad because it might lead to war, or a tense type of standoff, a la the cold war. That would be bad because it would lead to lots of stress in civilian/political life and possibly deaths through proxy wars (or worse).

In a less doomsday scenario, the US might have to concede its spot as world hegemony in favor of China as the dominating power. China will have a massive economic advantage fairly soon (and kind of already does). The rise of Chinese consumer culture will lead to the creation of more high quality Chinese goods and entertainment, which will then be exported to the US. Expect to see more Chinese made movies (or movies catered directly to China) and a higher amount of students learning Chinese in school. Basically expect China to take the US's place on the world stage. This scenario doesn't bother me that much and is likely unavoidable even with the treaty (just slower) but that is the gist of why the treaty should be in place."
161187,0,"&gt;So when Trump proves he marches to his own drum, he drives us to vote for him. Which I did. 

Why is marching to one's own drum such a desired trait? At the end of the day, the president's job is to put forth sensible policies, handle diplomatic relations and manage the executive branch of the government. Why is bravado seen as such a necessary element in this regard?

Many of us who voted for Clinton did so not because we liked her personality, but because Trump comes off as massively incompetent and lacks sound, or even consistent, policies. She was clearly more fit for the job.

Your vote, from what you describe, seems to be based on more superficial aspects of his personality rather than the core meat of his platform and skillset.

Hillary managed + 2.7 million. Sander's lost - 3.6 million more votes. That's a 6.3 million vote gap right there, add in the additional 2.3 million needed (to break the presidential threshold) and Sander's would've needed 8.6 million MORE votes.

934589,0,"If I had to guess, this could just be hollow words by the administration backed with no substance.

If I have to sit and think about this from a 30,000ft view. Trump is obviously willing to wage a war in the middle east - to some extent, but he is definitely more willing to wage a war and give attention to a net-new war (in the mind of the pubic). And that is a renewed war or effort on our southern border. Maybe this is to deflect from the middle-east and to some extent Russia.

How does this connect back to weed?

If we already have an extensive amount of funding going to wars in the middle east, Trump sees the ""best"" way to start a new expansion of the military industrial complex would be to amp up programs that basically are government subsidies for uneducated/low income individuals. 

This will result in expansion of programs like DHS, TSA, and CBP. The two latter professions hiring tens of thousands of uneducated people, who get more toys to play with (think drone, sensors, walls.....). 


If Trump can connect the idea that the border in its current state contributes to opiate addictions or that weed is funding cartels - he will use that to support the idea that ""something must be done on our southern border"".

His administration makes claims about Boeing, Lockheed Martin - saying they have saved billions, and makes up numbers all day. So the administration might just make a vocal blip about a topic, and then claim victory/success in 9 days - when in reality they have done nothing. Nothing has been signed in congress, etc.

The *most* control Trump immediately might have, is to try and sway budgets in to programs that he deems beneficial, so when he picks to spend on PBS or Customs and Border Patrol - you know what he is obviously going to pick. 

Trump is ineffective at getting his party, thus far, to get any legislation in congress/house passed. So in lieu of Trump setting direction for congress and making progress through these chambers, budget trickery and hallow executive orders is all the guy has.

He certainly doesn't know how to get anything done. Pence does, and if Trump had any ambition to try and get anything done in congress - he would have showed it by now. With that said, congress is going to set their own agenda, however disconnected form the president it might be. So watch for Trump to continue to be a distraction for the GOP - for when they eventually author some controversial shit."

246057,0,"&gt;The most important revelation in the WikiLeaks dump of John Podesta’s emails has nothing to do with Hillary Clinton. The messages go all the way back to 2008, when Podesta served as co-chair of President-elect Barack Obama’s transition team. And a month before the election, the key staffing for that future administration was almost entirely in place, revealing that some of the most crucial decisions an administration can make occur well before a vote has been cast.

https://newrepublic.com/article/137798/important-wikileaks-revelation-isnt-hillary-clinton

&gt;Michael Froman, who is now U.S. trade representative but at the time was an executive at Citigroup, wrote an email to Podesta on October 6, 2008, with the subject “Lists.” Froman used a Citigroup email address. He attached three documents: a list of women for top administration jobs, a list of non-white candidates, and a sample outline of 31 cabinet-level positions and who would fill them. “The lists will continue to grow,” Froman wrote to Podesta, “but these are the names to date that seem to be coming up as recommended by various sources for senior level jobs.”

Nothing wrong with feelings or opinions mind you. But if he had said ""I disagree with Obamas foreign policy in regards to our country for xyz reasons"" he would be viewed as a much more serious leader instead of a caricature.

I don't see any issue with people living out in the woods on their own with little other human contact not getting their kids vaccinated for example, those people will just have to be very up to date on a broad range of subjects that they won't be able to take advantage of society's built in structure for.  I guess in a way it's like saying somebody can strap their kid with a bomb in the comfort of their own home, so long as they don't ever get that kid/bomb within explosion radius of anyone else, which would be fine too! 

Basically IMO people should have the right to do whatever they want to do, so long as it doesn't impact other people and their right to do what they want to do.  In the case of vaccinating the stakes would be very very high as you'd have to ensure that the kid doesn't transmit anything that impacts someone else's quality of life as I assume ""being healthy"" would generally be what most people want to do.

It's complicated I guess

Edit: I should clarify that I don't think strapping a bomb to a kid would be ok in any way, and honestly not vaccinating your kids against awful diseases is downright dangerous too, but I do believe that people should be free. The issue is that strapping a bomb to/not vaccinating your kids is something that affects yourself, but your child instead; however in the US children are basically thought of as extensions of their parents until they're 18 so there you go"

360269,0,"I saw this issue coming.

I've frequently had fights with feminists on the internet for going too far and being too divisive. I made a few acquaintances who shared common beliefs and were frequently feeling under attack by the far-fringe feminist rhetoric and very aggressive personalities on the internet. 

I became disinterested after a while, but identified a seething resentment from a lot of working class white males who were struggling to get their problems heard when these feminists would keep telling them that the men were wholly in power and should shut up. They felt, many of them, like they had no voice. 

My own reaction was to continue to be more egalitarian in my economic views but resistant to the articles etc in the mainstream that reflected more radical feminist thought. I hoped the others would be doing the same. I hoped the others also recognised that at least part of it was diversified opinion pieces or that there were some things that publications put low priority on demanding rigour when they brought so many viewers. 

However, I was persistently worried that this vengeful streak in the left - this identity politics would divide and destroy the left. I actually fell out with a close relative on this issue - I said he was poisoning people against good men who would fight for abortion rights, fight against racism and sexism, fight for secular government and against sexual harassment but you had to start by accepting that economic status is the real indicator of power and not gender. 

A couple of years later, as this election geared back up, I re-engaged with my contacts. They'd turned from disenfranchised centre-left white men to fully engaged Trump supporters. The left had eroded their trust and I tried to edge them back. A familiar voice with similar original views trying to get them to make a rational decision. They weren't sexist; they were just distrusting that the left would listen to them. They were supposedly all-powerful, after all. 

Sanders had managed a good balance - all the left goodness but with a clear recognition of economic issues. He was seen as anti-establishment and a good mixture of values on social issues.  

However; by the time that I was engaging with them they were already emotional Trump supporters. The nominations were already won. The establishment, as they perceived it: comprising government departments and major publications, were now tainted for repeating feminist rhetoric or misleading statistics. A slight tendency to favour the left, some low publishing standards and high quality, high traffic and aggressively left sites had pushed them all the way to the alt-right. 

These voters felt like they were under siege. And when you feel like you're under seige, you won't come out. Even to an ally. And that's where they stayed, persistently and frustratingly pro-Trump.

They'd been told by someone finally that it wasn't all good in the world for them and that they should be listened to. And you can't easily move someone away from that if they feel it's the first time in many years. 

And that's how the left stole Christmas.

I love Bernie, his dedication to the issues he cared about, regardless of their popularity, was outright inspiring. Our country needs more Bernies. But Hillary Clinton can get more accomplished in her first week in the White House than Sanders would have in 4 years. 

And again, you're wrong about her. Go read those Wall Street speeches for yourself, I think you might be surprised. Here she is speaking to Deutsche Bank:

&gt;It’s important to recognize the vital role that the financial markets play in our economy, and that so many of you are contributing to. To function effectively, those markets and the men and women who shape them have to command trust and confidence, because we all rely on the market’s transparency and integrity. So even if it may not be 100 percent true, if the perception is that somehow the game is rigged, that should be a problem for all of us, and we have to be willing to make that absolutely clear. And if there are issues, if there’s wrongdoing, people have to be held accountable and we have to try to deter future bad behavior, because the public trust is at the core of both a free-market economy and a democracy.

She's not demonizing them, probably because that would be rude considering they paid her $250k to give this speech, but she isn't exactly encouraging them to rape and pillage the middle class either. She kind of sounds like a reasonable, competent leader to me.

Obama and Clinton have Lybian, Syrian, Iraqi, and Sudanese blood drenching their hands. Do yourself a favor and put in a bit of research... and that doesn't mean use Google, it means take your ass to the library! 

Obama toppled Lybia, and then attempted to topple Syria. 

Here's a start: look up Operation Sycamore. Read the fantastic NY Times article on the Op.

911 was a cheap magic trick. Only bad magicians use CG. The Israelis planted real explosives in the WTC but used CG to make it appear ""hijacked planes"" flew into them. Want proof?

A Pentagon employee crawled through the hole and saw no evidence of a plane:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIy9hjB3DGk

Major General Stubblebine confirms that the wreckage at the pentagon is consistent with a missile and not a plane:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jc1ql4TfCZw

This WTC witness insists it was a bomb, no plane:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bq1-BCeNcm0

These firemen said they counted 3 explosions. The Police/FBI are reported to have attributed this to vans with explosives in the WTC basement:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfxkcBmZfK0

You can also see raw footage (ie. not altered to show a CG plane) that shows the missile impacting the WTC (no plane):

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wF74zTLjNg

You can see a comparison showing the NBC footage showing no plane was digitally altered to show a plane (as well as adjust the colors to make the buildings appeared white and sky blue for increased psychological impact):

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPKq2K2dh6k

The altered footage in some cases is obviously fake, for example tiling smoke:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkzfKRe0gbc

But what wasn't CG was the explosions and the plane cutout shape they created. You can see those small explosions here (6 minute mark):

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rT1z90BB8E4&amp;feature=endscreen&amp;NR=1

The cutting charges were planted by Israeli Mossad posing as art students who rented a whole floor and got construction permits at the site, and made a temporary balcony. They even made a book about their ""art"" - which showed them standing next to boxes and boxes of explosives fuses in the WTC!

Mossad agents filmed the missile impacts/explosions (to add CG planes later and pass on to media) and later went up to the roof to plant radio jamming devices. They were arrested and this is documented by the FBI. There was traces of explosives in their van and they were set up filming BEFORE the attack:

Let me stress that again, the FBI arrested dancing Israelis on 911, not muslims. They refused to take lie detector tests for months, and when they did, they failed. So much of that FBI report is redacted, proof positive of guilt.

They needed to fake plane impacts because a real plane would be shredded by the WTC like cheese through a grater. That's why when the Transasia plane collided with a taxi, the wing broke off, and the taxi wasn't sliced in half at all:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQ29Zr7wWnw

According to a WTC architect in a 80s interview, the impact of a plane (300 tonnes) is nothing compared to the 13,000 tonnes of force trying to push the WTC over simply because of its enormous surface area.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E15GbdVaV-Q

WTC project management engineer atttests the buildings could survive multiple plane impacts.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fQlC2AIWrY

The WTC designers did a study for 600mph-1 impact which showed the towers would easily withstand the 911 attack.

Someone planted an engine (though wrong make) to further the plane deception:

Essentially the media got punked by Israel, because journalists just report what they're told. You can see another example of newscasters being fooled by a movie set into thinking it's a real plane accident. At the 7 minute mark in this video:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wozTHxykDwQ

The larger 911 plan required the destruction of the Washington bridge and Lincoln tunnel. That would take out the fiber optic cables linked to stock market/banking, markets would have crashed and there would be martial law introduced. You can see this TV report on the other Israeli vans that were intercepted, one of them exploded:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmpWe2Rhi_I

Israeli companies moved out of the building months before the attack. Israelis in America were warned in advance through an Israeli messaging service:

Hundreds of Israelis were flown out of America, despite a flight ban, to avoid them being arrested by the FBI, including the ""art students"":

Israel is the almost only country that benefited from the September 11 th attacks. In the words of Netanyahu, ""it's good for Israel"".

I wish that's how politics worked, but we both know it's not.

&gt; $450 billion is enough for single payer

Got a source? Cruz cited Bernies campaign plan, which would cost $30 TRILLION over 10 years. He cited the following statistics, which Bernie accepted: if you tax every American earning over $100k at 100%, that would pay for 5 months of single payer. If you seize every asset of Apple, google, Facebook, Amazon, and Exxonmobile, that would pay for 1 year of single payer. So no, 450 billion is no where near enough. 

&gt; America is insanely rich, we can afford it

Nothing is free. You want to, I assume, jack up the national debt by 30 trillion because I assume you think the national debt is meaningless. That's kind of a stock liberal talking point. Except it's not meaningless. We're 20 trillion in debt now, and the only reason that's ok at the moment is because we have never as a country defaulted on our interest payments, which is why our interest rates are so low. These interest payments are balooning in the coming years to cost more than entire entitlement programs. Each interest payment is paid for by the taxpayers, and if we ever default, we are fucked, since our interest rates will skyrocket."

&gt;It's your interpretation that she perjured herself in the defense of her client, a stunning interpretation since you weren't there and don't have access to all of the facts and are, in fact, looking for an excuse to think she's guilty.

So you think that a twelve year old rape victim who we know was raped, based on forensic evidence, is in fact making it up? That's the position you hold? Because that is the position you must hold to believe that the affidavit is not perjury.

890263,0,"from wiki. 

Sweden also applies a system of expansive offence counts. Other countries may employ more restrictive methods of counting. The Swedish police registers one offence for each person raped, and if one and the same person has been raped on a number of occasions, one offence is counted for each occasion that can be specified. For example, if a woman says she has been raped by her husband every day during a year, the Swedish police may record more than 300 cases of rape. In many other countries only a single offence would be counted in such a situation

Then there is this too:

Unlike the majority of countries in Europe, crime data in Sweden are collected when the offence in question is first reported, at which point the classification may be unclear. In Sweden, once an act has been registered as rape, it retains this classification in the published crime statistics, even if later investigations indicate that no crime can be proven or if the offence must be given an alternative judicial classification"

What really changes people's political allegiances are big historical landmark events. Great Depression tilted the nation, young and old both, towards liberal pro-labor policies. Foreign policy and national security concerns put Republicans in charge for most of the Cold War. The Civil Rights movement was huge, leading to a deep political rift between the north and the south that persists even today.

It couldn't possibly be that Breitbart is a publication that is ALSO enjoyed by non alt-right conservatives.

625986,0,"She had ordered them deleted weeks before the subpoena. A full investigation (by a lot more FBI agents than just Comey) found no evidence of obstruction of justice.

&gt;In looking back at our investigations into mishandling or removal of classified information, we cannot find a case that would support bringing criminal charges on these facts. All the cases prosecuted involved some combination of: clearly intentional and willful mishandling of classified information; or vast quantities of materials exposed in such a way as to support an inference of intentional misconduct; or indications of disloyalty to the United States; or efforts to obstruct justice. We do not see those things here.

Comey said:

&gt;Sen. Sasse: Do you think that Secretary Clinton break any laws related to classified data?
&gt;Director Comey: We have no evidence sufficient to justify the conclusion that she violated any of the statutes related to classified information.

The FBI is not in open revolt. FBI acting Asst. Dir. Jason Herring in the most recent deposition of details to Congress aid specifically that:

&gt;The Director did not equate ‘extreme carelessness’ with the legal standard of ‘gross negligence’ that is required by the statute. In this case, the FBI assessed that the facts did not support a recommendation to prosecute her or others within the scope of the investigation for gross negligence.

And he specifically clarified that Clinton never originated the classified data.

It's honestly all pretty open and shut. If the opponents had an ounce of critical reasoning, they'd have known the case was over as soon as they conducted interviews when the interviewees did not know what was recovered. Every lawyer and aide that went in there knew the FBI recovered tons of deleted emails. If they were hiding anything, they had one chance to come clean, or risk an instant felony conviction for lying to the FBI.

No loyalty is that strong. The first to cave gets immunity and the rest get slammed. Nobody had anything incriminating. The deleted emails did not recover anything incriminating.

Ultimately, there's thirty-thousand something odd turned in and recovered emails. Out of those, 110 had classified data in them, broken into 52 email chains. Out of those 110 emails, 3 had little 'c's in an inappropriate place. Zero had a proper header. Comey said:


&gt;MATT CARTWRIGHT: You were asked about markings on a few documents, I have the manual here, marking national classified security information. And I don’t think you were given a full chance to talk about those three documents with the little c’s on them. Were they properly documented? Were they properly marked according to the manual?

&gt;JAMES COMEY: No.

&gt;MATT CARTWRIGHT: According to the manual, and I ask unanimous consent to enter this into the record Mr. Chairman

&gt;CHAIRMAN: Without objection so ordered.

&gt;MATT CARTWRIGHT: According to the manual, if you’re going to classify something, there has to be a header on the document? Right?

&gt;JAMES COMEY: Correct.

&gt;MATT CARTWRIGHT: Was there a header on the three documents that we’ve discussed today that had the little c in the text someplace?

&gt;JAMES COMEY: No. There were three e-mails, the c was in the body, in the text, but there was no header on the email or in the text.

&gt;MATT CARTWRIGHT: So if Secretary Clinton really were an expert about what’s classified and what’s not classified and we’re following the manual, the absence of a header would tell her immediately that those three documents were not classified. Am I correct in that?

&gt;JAMES COMEY: That would be a reasonable inference.

So any reasonable person would stand to miss this. And as I mentioned earlier, Herring said:

&gt;""The fact that Secretary Clinton received emails containing '(C)' portion markings is not clear evidence of knowledge or intent,"" Herring wrote. ""In each of [the three] instances, the Secretary did not originate the information; instead, the emails were forwarded to her by staff members, with the portion-marked information located within the emails chains and without header and footer markings indicating the presence of classified information.""

So yeah. You want someone who received tens of thousands of mails, over a few years, to have noticed a couple 'c's in 3 emails in long email chains that she probably didn't even read. 

She assumed she wouldn't get sent classified data because you aren't supposed to send classified data to external email addresses. She figured everyone else would follow the regulation. She never saw a classified header, so she assumed none of it must be classified: If it was, she'd have seen a classified header. Classified data is supposed to always have that header, like Comey says.

The idea that there was some kind of shady plot in place to do this is just complete nonsense. It benefits her in no way, it didn't help her avoid the FOIA, none of the information originates from her or her department, so she would have had to rely on other people external to her department to send things, and she properly communicated on thousands of classified matters through proper channels. It takes only a slight perusal through the facts of the case to see this is not the kind of mishandling case that gets prosecuted. 

And no matter what you read on right wing bullshit factories, the FBI is not in revolt. There's plenty of Republicans there that would have probably loved to take Clinton down, but Comey wasn't the only investigator and ultimately they just do not have a case."

169785,0,"You are confusing reporting that turns out to be wrong with dishonest reporting, and you are blaming news organizations for the occasional sins of news reporters.

Brian Williams exaggerated some stories about himself and enough other unspecified instances to earn a serious censure from his employers. His career is still feeling the effects. They didn't find him making up important headlines or selling out to political parties, which is why he still has a job in the news business. He told small lies that threatened the credibility of the rest of his reporting. And that was enough to get him punishment and demotion. News companies take their credibility seriously. Reporters caught lying don't keep their jobs when the facts all come in.

Sometimes reporters report in good faith from sources that turn out to be faulty. That's not fake news, it's faulty news. It happens because the world is not a perfect place where everyone has all knowledge ahead of time and sources tell the truth all the time. When other news outlets investigate the story, they find the holes in it and raise questions. If the story is fundamentally flawed, the news source who ran it must acknowledge the error or risk losing all remaining credibility. Dan Rather's story on George W. Bush's avoidance of military service is a good example of a genuine attempt at news reporting brought down by reliance on poor sources, followed by retractions from his parent company and a slow winding down of his CBS journalism career. Since Rather had a long legacy of journalism before that report, falling for false evidence in the course of a larger story wasn't enough for CBS to cut all ties with him immediately. But the flawed story hurt him, and CBS, a lot. CBS didn't do a Fox News-style ""oops, our bad"" and shamelessly move on like nothing happened. They treated the story like the stain on their credibility that it was.

Reporting something that turns out to be false is not dishonest reporting, if you are accurately reporting the best information available to you. If there were warning signs you should have recognized, it's still not dishonest reporting. It's bad reporting that threatens your career. If you *knowingly* reported false information, it's usually the end of your career in serious journalism.

Fake news is when someone sits down in front of a computer and throws a bunch of catchy words into a headline, then writes a few sentences from their imagination to flesh it out. Like when Donald Trump talks about 3 million illegal voters. No evidence, no effort to gather evidence, no *pretense* that it's worth more than the 140 letters used to type it. Even Fox News doesn't play at that level. They're more about spinning real news negatively or hiding a few bits of fake information in the middle of real reporting."

25090,0,"&gt;it doesn't seem that Israel tries very hard to avoid hitting the wrong targets and people.

The ballpark math is pretty simple. Take the number of bombs dropped on Gaza and compare it to the number of deaths. According to the UN HRC (no friend of Israel), 2,251 Palestinians were killed both soldier and civilian. According to the UN's OCHA, Israel fired 5,830 missiles (in 4,028 air raids), 16,507 artillery and tank projectiles, and 3,494 naval shells over the course of the 7 week conflict in 2014. 

5830+16,507+3494 = 25,831 shells. 

There were of course bullets fired as well, but we will pretend there weren't any. Assigning bullet deaths to these shells will make the shells incorrectly appear deadlier than they were.

Also keep in mind that one missile can certainly kill a dozen or more individuals. We're going to assume each deadly shell/missile killed only one though. This also inflates how deadly they were. Approximately 1.5 missiles were fired per air strike, so on the other hand it isn't a situation where these shots are non-deadly because the first of 20 missiles killed the target first.

2251/25,831 = 8.7%

This number accounts for both soldier and civilian deaths. Ballpark math says &gt;90% of the strikes did not hit people at all. In a pseudo-country as dense as Gaza, that takes effort. Effort like calling and texting people in the area ahead of a strike, firing warning shots that make a loud noise but don't explode, dropping leaflets, and calling off strikes if civilians are visible."

112326,0,"I am just hoping that we can get a solution out of this, and the solution isn't all that difficult.

We simply need a dedicated government agency that is similiar to the FBI/CIA that has the sole purpose of protecting our political parties and agencies from cyber attacks.

The parties themselves do not have the money nor incentives to create properly secure systems, as doing so is incredibly expensive and the risks don't seem that great as it is so rare that these kinds of attacks turn into anything other than espionage (which affects people who are governing rather than the actual political campaigning).

This kind of agency would pull employees from the NSA, FBI and CIA to coordinate all of their forces and be totally integrated into the political parties as well. And the parts of the agency that explicitly work on protecting the Democrats could be Democrats, and the group protecting Republicans can be Republicans, with a bipartisan organizing structure that focuses on coordination and not reduplicating efforts.

We know that countries have hacked into both parties in the past, this is just the first time that a country has used these hacks to publish propaganda in order to help their favored candidate.

The Republicans should be for creating this agency, as it should be clear that in 2008 the Russians preferred Obama to McCain as Obama was inexperienced and McCain hates Russia and Putin with a burning passion. If Russia had thought of this kind of plan back then than they would have done the same thing they did to Hillary to McCain. Just imagine how damaging emails of McCain staffers calling Palin an idiot would have been to the campaign.

The main problem for this kind of agency is that it would be expensive, but I think that it is strongly in our national security interest to do this. And the agency could also focus on the security of government agencies, as those also keep on getting hacked."

Anyone who thinks we're going to deport 11 million people has not thought seriously about the issues.  It would be an epic disaster on both a humanitarian and economic level.

&gt; What do you mean ""not having a country?"" Why would it be a happy coincidence they are all brown? 

I mean that underlying much of the most virulent opposition to immigration is a fear that white people will no longer be a majority in the country due to immigration.  Immigration presents a direct challenge to white supremacy.  

&gt; Do you think enforcing immigration laws is actually a vendetta against brown people?

I think many of the people who want ultra-harsh enforcement of immigration laws do have something against brown people, yes.  Not all immigration hardliners are racists, but if you're a racist you are probably an immigration hardliner.

&gt; With respect to criminals, I have actually worked on a few of these cases. Guess what, when you have a violent criminal who has a long criminal history in their own country, the home country sometimes will not take them back. As a result, you either have to hold that person indefinitely or eventually release them back into the US. This is a real thing.

""Eventually release them back into the US"" as in ""let them out of prison once their sentence is complete.""  There's a lot more homegrown violent criminals that fit the same description.  It's not as if immigrants who commit crimes are given special treatment in that regard.

&gt; Deporting them may not open up slots, but suddenly making 11 Million people citizens will certainly ensure that those who have been awaiting citizenship for years will have to wait much, much longer. It's a cue system. That is how it works. If a bunch of people standing next to a line walk away that does not make the line shorter, but if they suddenly jump in the front of the line everyone behind them waits longer.

So as part of legalization hire some temporary workers to process all the new citizenship applications.  Problem solved."

175775,0,"In 2008, Barack Obama swept into the White House in a huge election win, winning both the EC and popular vote by wide margins. He was extremely popular. The Dems had a supermajority in the Senate and control of the house.

2010 remains the largest House swing since the 1930s, as the GOP swept back into control in a wave election.

In 1980 and 1984, Reagan won genuine landslides. Look at the electoral maps for those elections. They don't compare to anything today. The Democrats gained in Congress in 1982 and 1986.

It is always, *always* easier to motivate your base when you are not in control. The party with the White House earns the stink of Washington. 

While the Senate map is unfavorable for the Ds, and the House gerrymandered, I see no reason to believe that Rs will gain in Congress. I don't think the Dems take back either one, mind you, but they make serious progress to set up to do so in 2020. The real prize, though, is the 30+ gubernatorial mansions up in 2018.

27939,0,"I know it was. But Australia was a national scheme and she said she it may be worth doing on a national level.

&gt; “Now communities have done that in our country, several communities have done gun buyback programs,” she said. “But I think it would be worth considering doing it on the national level if that could be arranged.”

She should have chosen her words more carefully initially, but given the context of this and the fact that the second amendment exists, I believe she most likely intended to mean a voluntary scheme which pays above market value (but not sufficiently so that people try to arbitrage it).

The licensing isn't also that heavy, it's just that American licensing is so lax. Getting a category A or B license is remarkably simple. Basically you need to not have been convicted of a felony offence in the last five years, have taken a weapons safety course, have somewhere to securely store your weapon and have somewhere to actually shoot it safely.

Yeah but in my experience it's pretty much only lefties who actually use the term. (Probably because most people's political imaginations don't allow for substantial change, hence the shock at Trump.)

&gt; In Mussolini's Italy the left would have been the reactionary.

Communism never existed in Italy tho? The left was trying to do something that had never been done before, not return to an idyllic past *where they wanted to stay* (this is crucial). They wanted to get rid of Mussolini as instrumental to their project for a new form of civilisation -- not to return to an old one.

&gt; It just means anyone who wants to wind the clock back to before some already occurred social or political change - called the status quo ante.

This isn't quite right actually. An important part of reactionaryism isn't just that it wants to restore the status quo -- it wants to restore a mythologised (not necessarily fictional) status quo. So if you want to kill Hitler because he's a genocidal dictator who's killing lots of people and you want the violence to stop, you aren't a reactionary. If you want to kill Hitler to return to a glorious golden age of liberal democracy and peaceful co-existence, you're a reactionary. Likewise for the American right. Opposing healthcare because you think it's wasteful isn't reactionary. Opposing healthcare because of some mythologised American dream or whatever-the-fuck crazy arguments Republicans use -- that is."

Hillary knew the rules just like trump, if she wanted to win she should have campaigned to do so.

She probably just assumed we wouldn't change.. And that was where her issues began"
212340,0,"The scare quotes were somewhat sarcastic. And just for clarity I'm a moderate-liberal NPA who registered Dem to vote for Bernie Sanders.

I don't think I have good answers, but creating further tension between the people who live in a community and the people policing it won't help. I live in a mid-sized city in Florida that has a large number of gun deaths in our poorer black parts of town. We have intense, obvious geographical segregation. Gun deaths are our number one crime issue. Now, we don't have the formal gang activity that an Englewood has, but most of our gun crime has to do with drug dealing and related problems. Legalizing or decriminalizing cannabis will help with a small piece of the puzzle (we're also about to get medical marijuana so I'm interested in seeing how that shakes things up). Will this just end up with drug dealers selling other drugs with different margins? Maybe, I don't know I'm not an expert.

First off I differ with most Democrats in that I don't believe gun control that's being advocated for will do much to prevent low income area gun deaths, re: background checks. I don't think those regulations are bad because I do genuinely think its too easy to get a gun, even though I am not anti-gun and have shot them my whole life.

Having spoken with and worked with law enforcement about this actual issue, what actually works and eases tensions is community policing. I know this has become a popular term as of late with liberals, but this is what I've been told by Republican-leaning beat cops who did actually work in dangerous neighborhoods where I am that what worked best was them actually working the neighborhoods, walking around and getting to know people. You can gain a mutual respect that way. People in these communities don't want their neighborhoods to be dangerous and want to work with police, but when they fear the police or don't have a relationship with them you end up with broken trust that worsens the situation for the citizens in the neighborhood and makes the job even more dangerous for police.

Obviously the real answer is that you need ways of revitalizing these areas and bringing more and more people out of poverty (without just bulldozing it, gentrifying it and moving the poverty elsewhere), but to be honest, I don't think either party (or any 3rd party) has a good answer for that on a national level that a president could even impact. Regardless that holistic solution to low income crime is complicated and slowly evolving. People want immediate results and that's just not how anything happens.

Absolutely nothing is easy about this, but I can tell from my personal experiences having an overwhelmingly white police force act with impunity in black communities ain't going to quell violence. Yes, it's complicated and there are those who say the impetus should be with the communities to promote a better culture or whatever. I don't know for certain, but there are small incremental things that can be done to help, repairing the relationship between us as human beings first is important. You brought up Englewood and it doesn't help that the LAPD has a history as a terribly corrupt awful police force.

I'm interested in discussing any of these elements more, also this is all off the top of the head, so if you think I'm saying bullshit call me out on it."

There's no driver at the wheel

And the sewers are all muddied with a thousand lonely suicide

And a dark wind blows

The government is corrupt

And we're on so many drugs with the radios on and the curtains drawn.

We're trapped in the belly of this horrible machine

And the machine is bleeding to death 

The sun has fallen down

And the billboards are all leering

And the flags are all dead at the top of their poles 

It went like this: 

The buildings tumbled in on themselves

Mothers clutching babies 

Picked through the rubble

And pulled out their hair 

The skyline was beautiful on fire

All twisted metal stretching upwards

Everything washed in a thin orange haze 

I said, ""Kiss me, you're beautiful -

These are truly the last days"" 

You grabbed my hand 

And we fell into it

Like a daydream 

Or a fever

448244,0,"Isn't it? It seems like a lot of the roles of the job are similar to what a CEO does. Take advice from advisors, make decisions on key things, delegate down to people you trust, maintain relations with other countries (companies). The CEO is ultimately responsible for everything that happens in his company; just like the president is responsible for everything in the executive branch.

If you had to pick someone in the world whose job is most closely ""CEO of America"" president would be it.

&gt;like you get to make all the calls and other people can take on the responsibility when you're out

Isn't this precisely how it works? The president passes an executive order and he isn't personally executing it, he has entire departments of government that handle the actual work. Example: president declares we are going to the moon and tasks NASA with doing it. He might make some decisions about how much we are really willing to sink and other super high level important decisions but no engineering discussion would ever make it to him. The head of NASA is responsible to the president to get us to the moon, and so on down the hierarchy. Its not like the president is designing lunar landers

The president is ultimately responsible to the public for everything the legislative branch does, but he delegates nearly all the responsible of implementing what he wants to have happen to people in his government"

&gt;Now, moving passed that, just discrediting them as ""living in a fantasy world"" and not attempting to appeal to them is the same reason we now have Trump as President Elect. They have fears that they just want addressed, if those fears aren't addressed they will vote against democrats every time.

As much I respect your flair, this is bullshit. We have Trump because democrats did not turn out to vote, not because Democrats refuse to address ""legitimate"" concerns about gun possession rights. It happens. 

There are no legitimate concerns as to gun rights, because there are no plans or plots to restrict said rights. Every year this bs is touted, and what happens? Nothing. Not even mandatory background checks.

Here's the quote on private and public policy.

&gt; You just have to sort of figure out how to -- getting back to that word, ""balance"" -- how to balance the public and the private efforts that are necessary to be successful, politically, and that's not just a comment about today. That, I think, has probably been true for all of our history, and if you saw the Spielberg movie, Lincoln, and how he was maneuvering and working to get the 13th Amendment passed, and he called one of my favorite predecessors, Secretary Seward, who had been the governor and senator from New York, ran against Lincoln for president, and he told Seward, I need your help to get this done. And Seward called some of his lobbyist friends who knew how to make a deal, and they just kept going at it. I mean, politics is like sausage being made. It is unsavory, and it always has been that way, but we usually end up where we need to be. But if everybody's watching, you know, all of the back room discussions and the deals, you know, then people get a little nervous, to say the least. So, you need both a public and a private position. And finally, I think -- I believe in evidence-based decision making. I want to know what the facts are. I mean, it's like when you guys go into some kind of a deal, you know, are you going to do that development or not, are you going to do that renovation or not, you know, you look at the numbers. You try to figure out what's going to work and what's not going to work."

Gone is the gold standard and the 9 to 1 rule where for every 1 dollar of gold the banks would loan 9 dollars. Growth is what makes our markets go. Now this is the fundamental question, do you want Goverment to produce growth or do you want the innovators and business men to do it?

Usually the leads are wide enough that, while all the votes are eventually counted, you don't really hear reports about updates.  Places like Reuters, AP, CNN, et cetera, update their totals for the historical record, but that's about it.

It's of slight interest now because Jill Stein is trying to mitigate going down in the history books as the Ralph Nader of 2016 by calling for recounts in places likes PA.

The reality is, no one realistically expects the recounts (even if all three happen) to change any results."

How is it you can't comprehend the things that are even so easily and basically explains to you? I even gave you a guide on the fact that you can't think of things from the past through today's values and situation. Under emergency circumstances like a world war that presents an existential threat it is well justifiable to put people that are quite possibly allied with your sworn enemy into camps. It's really not that difficult to comprehend, yet here we are and you can't even wrap your mind around the most basic things. 

Let's try this; imagine if among the Japanese population there really had been a lot of people allied to the Emperor within the USA. They could have spied on our forces being shipped out, identified targets, launched full on assaults on targets, spread terrorism through bombings, they could have assassinated and bombed people and places ... JAPAN WAS OUR ENEMY!!! What is it with you people that you dint get that kind of basic self-preservation stuff?

Your feelings do not qualify what is or isn't un-American; the most un-American thing based in reality and fundamental law is the preservation and protection of America and the American people, if that means in certain circumstances that we have to take certain actions to suspend people's rights for a limited time to ensure safety and security and defense integrity, then there is no rational human being that would disagree with that. It has absolutely nothing to do with people who don't look like me, you racists. It has to do with people allied or even just likely allied with those who are our enemies and attacking us. 

No one is scared, that's just more liberal nonsense spun up in your mind based on your chip on your shoulder. It has to do with rational, sane, mentally healthy people looking out for their own safety and security and interests without exposing themselves to danger and risks and death and destruction. I know you guys don't seem to have that capacity and somehow your minds must have been damaged somehow, but if America is to survive, we are going to need to get you insane types under control and prevent you traitors from throwing open the gates to the attacking savages because you think they just want to be friends.

Correct me if I'm wrong but I think part of the President's duties is representing the people who elected him/her. Assuming some women do vote for him, and in the hypothetical world where he does become president, how could his misogynistic and backward-thinking views on women possibly not effect the way he treated the American public, half of whom are women? 

It would be one thing if this disgusting quote was the exception to a history of respectful relationships with women, but there are dozens of other cases like this that have come up. Trump has stated that he thinks there should be some form of punishment for women who get abortions, and the scary thing is, there's a chance he could be placed in a position where he could push for legislation for something exactly like that happening.

The discussion that there are no jobs and the economy sucks is a red herring; there are jobs, but jobs are changing and people are deciding not to keep up with changing times.  People don't realize that the standard of living they enjoy is the top of a pyramid filled with the bones of the worlds poorest people.  By developing an educated middle class in these other destitute countries, the US is in competition with those that were once in servitude to the mighty American empire, the people of these other countries are hungry for a standard of living that allows them access to drinkable water, consistent electrical power, clean and healthy food, etc...  so rather than looking inward and asking how the US can compete, they point a finger and blame the outside.  

There is equal blame on the culture of corporate greed and improving shareholder value through short sighted quarterly earnings, that is the engine that drives money and investment outside of the US borders to procure low income workers, and the growing divide between the wealthy and the middle class keeps the cost of living higher for everyone, and the poor pay the biggest price while the rich simply get richer. 

But there are jobs, people are employed; low skill jobs are disappearing as they ever have throughout history but Trump is making people believe the situation is worse, that there are simple solutions to extremely complex problems, and that's what should scare people the most, the naivety to truly believe that there are simple solutions to any of this; that sort of naive thinking leads to actions that only worsen the problems."

Of course you should never trust just one source, and you should always read critically.  But that's a far cry from saying the news (actual journalism) is generally untrustworthy.

The medium does matter.  Cable news is all about ratings, so they are prone to sensationalize (no viewers, no ad revenues).  And on the Internet, if you're getting something for free, you are much more likely to be the product than than the consumer (all the fake news on Facebook, e.g., generates ad revenue, so little lying shitheads are making gobs of money on deliberately misleading people).  Sources that you have to pay for, say, the NY Times, are less dependent on flashy stories whose soul purpose is to increase clicks.  And of course they want to sell papers, but this means they have to be accountable to readers and not just attract advertisers.  Furthermore, not all sources are bound to the 24 hour news cycle.  Some of the best journalism out there can be found in weekly magazines, e.g.  So yes, medium matters a lot.

&gt;Media fawning 

Maybe at the beginning (during the moonlight period most normal presidents have) and at the end, but the press certainly was not particularly kind and called him out frequently. One big difference, though, is that Obama knew how to be a statesman and handle criticism. He didn't fly off the handle, angrily fire off tweets, send out his press secretary to lie to everyone, etc. etc. etc.  He didn't treat the press like an enemy state.

I really don't get Trump's anger at the press. They were a major reason he got into the White House. He should be practically *thanking* them for all that free press he got. They fell down on their job during the primaries and campaign and turned it into a media circus. I blame them for much of Trump's rise.

Really? I must live in the one part of America that wasn't completely outraged and fearing for our nation because of this. /s It's actually not a problem and is perfectly in line with normal GDP anyway. Trump's statement on GDP and what he would do with it was completely nonsensical.

According to historian and political rankings, at the moment, George W. Bush is consistently among the lowest tier of presidents. He ranks among the two lowest presidents of the last 100 years, usually beating out Herbert Hoover. These take into account popular opinion of the president, their achievements, and failures. President Bush has almost no major lasting domestic achievements, which is bad mark against him. His foreign policy vision was rejected by the international community and practically rewritten by Barack Obama.

It's too early to judge Obama as well, considering Trump might undo many of his accomplishments. So it's also too early to discount President-Elect Trump. But his historically low approval ratings coming into his honeymoon period is not a good sign, and he doesn't seem to have any desire to assuage these voters concerns at the moment."

653893,1,"Hitler was not elected Fuhrer, he was democratically elected as chancellor. After the Reichstag fire the Nazi party was able to pass the Reichstag Fire Decree, allowing the chancellor to declare what was essentially marshal law. Using this power Hitler rounded up thousand of community party members. Even with all this the Nazi party remained a minority in parliament.

To get around this Hitler used his power as chancellor to bring the Enabling Act up for a vote. Using the power granted to him by the Reichstag Fire Decree, the remaining Communist and Socialist Democrat members of the parliament were arrested or otherwise prevented from attending the vote. A few Socialist Democrats were present to oppose, but the vote went overwhelmingly in favor of the Nazi party. Once passed, the Enabling Act allowed Hitler to legislate without consent of parliament for four years. Hitler was now a democratically elected, constitutionally appointed dictator.

Maybe you can see why some people are concerned about a man who wants to drastically expand the power of the executive branch through executive orders, who's party demands absolute loyalty to the platform, and together the president and his congressmen would conspire to appoint multiple supreme court justices that share their radical ideology. All the while this man, Donald Trump, promises that he will begin his administration by rounding up 11 million ""ethnic troublemakers."" Such an act would necessitate the construction of new holding and transport facilities across the country, as well as a dedicated force of police officers tasked with rooting out these individuals from established homes and communities.

Do I think Trump is going to be America's equivalent of Adolf Hitler? No, he is an incompetent buffoon. The reason these parallels exist is because they subscribe to the same ideology: fascism. Same principles, same strategies, same policies. The real threat is Donald Trump's influence on the Republican Party taking the radical elements mainstream. That is exactly what we saw tonight, with Trump spouting conspiracy theory nonsense straight off of Breitbart and Infowars.

417386,0,"Gotta say: that article was full of giant leaps of logic that don't seem to connect. Example: 

&gt;We have no reason to believe that the low number of prosecutions means only that exact amount of voter fraud is happening. Rather, it could mean a lack of enforcement is failing to reveal the bulk of the violations that are occurring.  Thus, as with many types of crimes, especially victimless crimes, the real number of cases is likely significantly higher than the number reported.

Using a lack of violations as proof of lots of violations is in crackpot territory. 

&gt;So now that we know voter fraud is a serious issue, what are some solutions to this problem?

So to paraphrase: evidence of the violations doesn't exist, therefore there are a lot of violations. Now that there are a lot of violations, we know that voter fraud is a serious issue.

630621,0,"The Republican Party had been dying a slow death since 1992, when Ross Perot proved that there was enough demand for a crazed billionaire running on a platform of protectionism to spoil the GOP. The Republican Party has won the popular vote once since then, and you could argue that without a GOP friendly SCOTUS, they would have won no elections in that time period.

Post HW Bush, the Republican Party had been a disperate collection of groups with declining levels of overlapping interests. Fiscal Conservatives have increasingly wanted to move left socially in order to get their budgets passed. The Religious Right want to move towards Christian Nationalism. And then there are Cultural Conservatives who are increasingly leaning towards White Nationalism and isolationism.

Whenever there was no national election, the GOP could easily function as a diverse group of regional interests that all shared a common brand name. But almost every national election has seen contention. 92 and 96 were ruined by Perot stealing some of the Cultural Conservative vote. GW Bush proved to be a master of uniting these three groups, but he also didn't accomplish any of their goals and generally made the party more contentious. McCain was pressured into choosing Palin as his VP and that sunk him in 08. Santorum almost became the nominee in 2012 despite splitting early votes with Huckabee and Gingrich.

What Trump has done is finally cleave off a decent chunk of the party. He has united religious and cultural conservatives on a reactionary and isolationist agenda that is driving away moderates. The tent will continue to narrow and every primary cycle will get worse, until the GOP either collapses or reinvents itself as a centrist entity.

Again, the GOP currently cannot win a national election, and has been on increasingly uneasy footing since 92. Unless they figure out how to reunite Trump's base with suburban women, and pick up some Latinos along the way, we may be looking at a period in American history where the Democrats consistently hold the White House while the right sorts itself out slowly and ineffectivley."

Even if a lot of those people tried to start some kind of civil war, it would be stomped out within days, at most a week. I feel like these people who make these threats seriously think our armed forces are a push over or something. Also, you want to create a compelling argument to take away all guns? That would be it right there. Something like that happening would be like a wet dream to all the die hard liberals out there.

Because what I see is Trump praising the LGBT community on the RNC stage. I see him proudly holding up the rainbow flag at his rally.

I see members of the gay community and many others praising Trump as the most progressive Republican nominee on LGBT issues in history.

470643,0,"&gt; Approval ratings and polls mean the same thing they did. The polls were not far off. It's people like Nate Silver's predictions based on the polls that were far off. 

It's wrong to singleout Nate Silver's projections, as they were among the best of the projections. Additionally, frequently 538 mentioned the possibility and probability of a things like a Popular Vote/Electoral College. It's sites like the NYT's Upshot and the Huffington Post that were really off. 538 demonstrated their method well, but at the end of the day, it relies on the polls that are released.

The polls were abnormally far off however, especially in the rust belts states. These are for a variety of reasons; the decrease in journalistic outlets and funding led to less strong polls in certain states, a wrong prediction for the likely voter model, and even the possibility of people lying to pollsters.

There are problems with the polls that need to be addressed, and we won't see this until more concrete data from the people that voted comes out.

The problem is that people don't treat a 30% chance of something happening as a possibility. In October, if you told Clinton voters that there was a 30% chance Donald Trump might not win, people would not be inclined to freak out. But if you told them that there was a 30% chance there might get shot by a gun, that would react more swiftly."

From John Schindler, a conservative voice critical of Trump and his appearance of Kremlin connections. Former NSA, current faculty at Naval War College. He broke the ""NSA withholding intelligence from White House"" story. Interestingly, these were published in The Observer, owned until very recently by Jared Kushner. FWIW, Schindler is critical of the Obama administration's handling of Russia, and is definitely conservative, but even more critical of Trump and his handling of the Russia issue (I'm understating his stance here).

From the blog of Louise Mensch, a former British conservative MP and current investigative reporter residing in America who is another voice very critical of Trump's possible Russia connection. In fact, she's developed quite a theory about it. FWIW, she seems to have some legit sources, as she was the person who broke the story that the FBI obtained FISA warrants related to the Trump campaign.

&gt; 
&gt; Well now we are within striking distance with a candidate who gives you a taste of your own medicine. So fuck you dude. It's time you get what's coming to you

I think the thing most often overlooked is that many people on the left that have decent, well paying jobs, that so easily dismiss those who feel like this country has left them behind, are actually the ones trying to fix some of that very situation. And every attempt is met with obstruction and demonization and fear of the government.

They're the ones pushing for social services and jobs programs to those who feel abandoned, and trying to come up with a solution to the rural towns with nothing left.  

The right is constantly voting against their self-interests thinking if we just get these liberals to stop taxing and wasting money we can bring low-skill high paying manufacturing jobs back.

The truth is we can't, the only way we can compete with Chinese labor pay and standards is if we bring them here.  No minimum wages, minimum safety and environmental regulations, paying pennies on the dollar for jobs that will break their back and ruin their bodies and then when they're broken, send them off with no social services to keep them clothed and fed.  It's just not possible, and sadly, the left does a pretty shitty job in the PR department conveying that.  They can't bring back all these jobs for low skill workers, so instead they want to find a way to subsidize some of their housing, health care, and food expenses.  Yet, those very same people that would benefit from that constantly vote against it in some backwards attempt to tell us to ""fuck off"". 

Even if Trump gets elected, most of them will continue to have well paying high-skill jobs, it's those who need the social programs most that will watch them dry up."

The fact is Single Payer is not popular with voters.  80% of Colorado voter rejected Single Payer on the ballot in this election, and that's a left leaning state that Clinton won, Single Payer even failed in Bernie's home state of Vermont because it cost too much, which should tell you how unpopular Single Payer is.

Funny thing is about Jones is that I stopped watching him for a while in the summer cause he was seeming to go way out in the spectrum, but than I came back when I had a conversation with a veteran who claimed he was vaccinated prior to being shipped out east.

437319,0,"2 of the 3 Republican presidential wins since 2000 were on the backs of an EC win that went in the face of the popular vote. That means 66% of their wins were despite not getting most of the votes.

If you were principled and not only frustrated with obvious problems when they don't benefit you, you'd see the problem with that math too.

You'd also see the problem with several elections where Democrats won majorities of votes and Republicans still got healthy majorities in the House.

If one party is often getting less votes and still enjoying majorities, you have to admit there is clearly a flaw in whatever system is being used and probably manipulated/abused so as to allow a minority to govern as the majority for years."

Doesn't even have to be malfeasance.  An audit would do away with anyone questioning the legitimacy of any election.  You'd be able to just check the audit if it was open enough.

The point is you guys are the point that a conservative persons existence is racist it's nature. We open our mouths were racist, we stay silent were racist, we wake up in the morning were racist it's just a god damn joke anymore.

And there hasn't been a racist crusade against Obama, we just don't like his policies. When you guys attack Bush, Romney, McCain etc are you racist then? No you opposed on policy, but no because it's Obama we must disagree because he is black. That is such a horse shit attempt to paint a group of people as something they are not. You want the ability to say whatever you want no matter how hypocritical and if we get uppity on our side, you slam down that race card so fast that you just laugh with glee.

Ofcourse you will just dismiss my post, keep pumping Trump is racist as fact card and go about your merry way. But when you do, do your research on Hillary in the Congo and Haiti.....she hasn't met a black man she can't murder, rape or steal from to enrich herself and her friends.

But it is being condoned, and it's being normalized, and Hillary is a big reason why.

You have struck the nail, my friend - there are people who think that if the democrats were to suddenly scale back on corruption then they would be ceding every political race to the republicans; that the only way to stand against corruption is to use corruption. A lot of people who are unfazed by this are unfazed for the same reasons: that they don't care what it takes for their team to win. A simple analogy would be that the only people who didn't give a shit about Deflategate were Patriots fans, and the reason everybody else gave a shit is because the Patriots are as unlikable as Clinton.
 
&gt; Even if not every perceived action of corruption comes straight out of her mouth, all of the little pieces add up in favor of her, and that should raise some red flags that there is a much bigger problem that isn't being addressed.

And this is what I always argue: there have been too many whiffs of shit in the past year alone, let alone the decades of investigations.

If I want to loan a friend a firearm it needs to be transferred through a FFL, because otherwise it would be a ""loophole in universal background checks"" according to the CA Democratic party. He then needs to transfer it back to me upon return. Each transfer has a 10-day waiting period. That's 2 trips to the FFL and 20days of waiting (and btw paying the FFL to store the firearm).

Alternatively, can you give me a single good reason why I, someone who already owns 3 rifles and a shotgun, needs to wait 10days to take possession of another rifle? There is no logical effect on public safety in making someone who already has a firearm wait 10days for another.

Furthermore, why the \**** does the waiting period start when the firearm shows up at the store rather than when I order the thing?

In short, there's a lot of annoyance, and a decent amount of cost, and no benefit.

For reference, see Silvester V Harris, which will soon be on it's way to the supreme court, challenging the California 10day waiting period for those who already own firearms.

[edit] As an analogy, if there's nothing wrong with delaying a firearm purchase, then what about delaying abortions? Having additional hoops to jump through and waiting periods?

I think Trump is a lunatic and possible a sociopath of some type, but I don't think he's stupid. He's smart enough to use bravado to sway the opinions of millions and he's smart enough to make millions: whether they were made through financial brilliance(which I doubt) or borderline legal scammy tactics, it takes some amount of smarts to do so(or if what he did was illegal, it takes some smarts to get away with it).

His problem isn't that he's stupid. It's that his motivations are selfish. Obama was definitely more of a ""I want things to be better for everyone"" type, so he's going to be talking to Trump and likely trying to paint a picture of how ""everyone being happy makes you more successful"". Like Sanders he's a pragmatist, he's dealing with the hand he was played. To just throw the towel in now would be petty.

Most presidents have been very intelligent, but a lot of their philosophy and the way they do things is grounded on their core beliefs. Intelligence can also manifest itself in many different ways, and some are less obvious. Oratory skills obviously are easy to demonstrate. But there are really smart people out there who have great ideas about how to fix shit, but have difficulty inspiring people.

Obama was a pretty good dude, but I think it's a bit silly to put him up on a pedestal like this. He's still in office, and past transition periods have also included many meetings between  the standing potus and president elect."

The problem is that a significant fraction of the core voter population the GOP relies on doesn't really have a plan, or care about grand plans so long as they have jobs, money, and the freedom to do what they want in their spare time.

They feel like they're getting fucked by the government (because it's an easy target), so less of it is good.

Having a plan means embracing that government is useful for something and should have a role.  They're not going to start advancing serious plans until they have a voter base that demands them.

So long as demonizing things that are bad without actually suggesting good alternatives and the promise of cutting taxes gets the GOP votes, there's no reason to change course.

Only when they're losers who have to sell why they should have power will they come up with something to actually stand behind.  A safe House of Representatives, a relatively safe Senate (due to stronger focus on downballot elections), and a centrist court give them a lot of reason to just sit back and do as little as possible to avoid rocking the boat."

That is blatantly false, as I have clearly irrefutably demonstrated. That is a lie, period.

33% Z &gt; Y &gt; X  
32% Y &gt; X &gt; Z  

Y is preferred to X by a huge 65% landslide, but loses to X anyway.

Z is a spoiler, pure and simple. Z has _no chance_ against Y or X (would lose to either by a 67% landslide to either of them), but by being in the race, causes X to win.

And indeed, those middle row voters would be better off to insincerely/tactically rank Y in first place instead of Z, so they could get Y instead of X. Voting for the spoiler Z causes them to get their least favorite candidate.

It is nonsense.  The only way to cut costs from a program meant to cover everyone is to re-implement the exclusions that keep the sickest people out of the program.

That is why republicans say they will come up with a new bill after they repeal the old one.  They have no bill and no ideas for a bill.  The ACA was technically what republicans wanted, a bill that requires everyone to buy private insurance.

The only fix would be to limit hospitals to billing medicaid rates for everything.  Something no republican is prepared to do.  If you took that step, you might as well allow a public option that has people buy into medicaid."

148957,0,"Two properly marked classified emails, Claimed by the State Department in July, but there were a lot more emails with classified information send and received by Clinton. 

Straight from the FBI's director's statement

https://www.fbi.gov/news/pressrel/press-releases/statement-by-fbi-director-james-b-comey-on-the-investigation-of-secretary-hillary-clinton2019s-use-of-a-personal-e-mail-system

&gt; Although we did not find clear evidence that Secretary Clinton or her colleagues intended to violate laws governing the handling of classified information, there is evidence that they were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information.
&gt; 
&gt; For example, seven e-mail chains concern matters that were classified at the Top Secret/Special Access Program level when they were sent and received. These chains involved Secretary Clinton both sending e-mails about those matters and receiving e-mails from others about the same matters. There is evidence to support a conclusion that any reasonable person in Secretary Clinton’s position, or in the position of those government employees with whom she was corresponding about these matters, should have known that an unclassified system was no place for that conversation. In addition to this highly sensitive information, we also found information that was properly classified as Secret by the U.S. Intelligence Community at the time it was discussed on e-mail (that is, excluding the later “up-classified” e-mails).
&gt; 
&gt; None of these e-mails should have been on any kind of unclassified system, but their presence is especially concerning because all of these e-mails were housed on unclassified personal servers not even supported by full-time security staff, like those found at Departments and Agencies of the U.S. Government—or even with a commercial service like Gmail.

She was authorized to classify information on sight, and declassify information, either she or her predecessor classified, as for storage, 

&gt;(g)  Consistent with law, executive orders, directives, and regulations, each agency head or senior agency official, or with respect to the Intelligence Community, the Director of National Intelligence, shall establish controls to ensure that classified information is used, processed, stored, reproduced, transmitted, and destroyed under conditions that provide adequate protection and prevent access by unauthorized persons.

How is streamlining citizenship creating a massive loophole? By making citizenship more accessible, these people could gain citizenship legally. No loopholes required. Before you mention that they can get citizenship legally now, look how well the current immigration process is doing, or rather I should say how poorly it is doing. How is expecting people to follow the law ""oh so evil?"" If the law is not moral, then it is not just. If a law is not just, why should it be followed?

Would it be fair for the world to call you a murderer with absolute certainty, just as you just did to Trump?

The position of President was never intended to be determined by the National popular vote, but to give each state a set number of votes determined by the states population, partially in order to prevent states with larger populations creating a Tyranny of the Majority, partially because direct democracy was a lot more difficult when the system was founded.

Withholding sensitive information they fear may be leaked (given how worried they are about leaks from the administration, would you not say this is justified?) is not the same as colluding with an enemy state.

Meanwhile the republicans we're sabatoging Veteran health bills in an attempt to gain political power by trying to force Obama to revoke his deal with Iran using my fellow Veterans Health as a fucking gambling chip.  

Also the Executive is larger I agree.  My point was claiming that the division came only from him and not mostly from others is insane.

312709,0,"I would say one of the biggest reasons people voted for Trump is simply that they didn't want Hillary to win. Regardless of if she actually committed any crime, there was a preponderance of incidences where Hillary appeared to be corrupt and mistrustful. I would link that sentiment to the emails that exposed the attempts to influence the Democratic nomination through underhanded methods. Additionally, the national exposure of her private server further led to an image of hiding her actions from the public eye. 

I am not trying to spark debate on the validity of any of those claims, but it certainly had an impact on voters. Especially when people wanted a change from the elite inner circle of politicians that seemed to have been running Washington for the last 30 years. The fact that Obama furthered many of Bush's policies, insurance premiums skyrocketed under Obama care, and the increasing mass surveillance as unveiled by Snowden all factored into a cry for a ""fuck you"" candidate to the perceived establishment. 

I'd also say that the media perpetuated a narrative that Hillary was going to win in a landslide, which only energized the Trump base and demotivated Clinton supporters from voting.

We think everybody reads the news every day, five times a day, and everybody is into politics.  Most of the Trump base is still oblivious to this stuff; they voted and then they forgot,  and just went about their daily lives.  When they hear something in the coffee shop or from a radio, they just file it away under same old politics in D.C.   They aren't politically savvy and don't care to be.   

The news will eventually reach them and affect them like a great mudslide;  it will start out slow, little doubts will come to thier mind, it will build speed slow, they will find their friends talking about the same doubts, and then one day, something will happen that will engulf them all and damage their contained world view.  

Continued WH incompetence could eventually do it in perhaps three to six months;  repeal of ACA would definitely cause the mudslide to quicken, but ACA repeal is not likely to happen this year, so that's out for now; the lack of job creation will add to the slide, but that is two years out before he is held accountable. 

My best bet: WH policy screw ups and the Russian connection will make the mud slide really move. The Russian problem is going to blow up fast and that alone will destroy his base and his presidency, especially if Gorsuch has already been approved and seated on the SC, then at least 8-10% of his support will abandon him because they won that single battle, which is all they cared about.

We all think the Trump and GOP base will somehow justify the Russian reports, but I don't think so.  I've been around for a long time, I know a lot of Trump supporters and when it comes down to US sovereignty or supporting a government that was treasonous, they are going to abandon Trump, and hopefully hold the GOP accountable for many years to come. 

We want it to happen now, but we have to be a little patient and let  events take their natural course.  I am certain this is not going to end well for Trump."

If you ever wondered how anyone got the idea that the Clinton's might be pay-to-play, here you go.

*PREFACE:*

&gt;In his first presidential campaign in 1992, Bill Clinton famously asserted that he and his wife, Hillary, came as a package deal.

&gt;**“Buy one, get one free,” he said.**  [~](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/01/05/buy-one-get-one-free-bill-clintons-turn-as-his-wifes-presidential-bonus/)

.

&gt;Mrs. Clinton told voters in Kentucky on Sunday that Mr. Clinton would be “in charge of revitalizing the economy, because, you know, he knows how to do it,” especially “in places like coal country and inner cities.” On a campaign swing this month before the West Virginia primary, she said her husband has “got to come out of retirement and be in charge” of creating jobs. [~](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/17/us/politics/bill-hillary-clinton-administration-economy.html)

.

&gt;Dick Morris: when Clinton is in trouble, he resorts to the world of soft money for allies.

[""The Comeback Id""](http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2008/07/clinton200807) friends and associates that Clinton has acquired since he left office:

&gt;the world of rich friends, adoring fans, and borrowed jets in which he travels has skewed his judgment or, at a minimum, created uncomfortable appearances of impropriety

&gt;it is also beyond dispute that Clinton has blended the altruistic efforts of his philanthropy with the private business interests of some of his biggest donors in ways that are surpassingly sloppy, if not unseemly, for any former president.

In return for this, he has been received at the Clinton White House and more recently at Clinton-sponsored social events in New York and Paris. 

&gt;As a close friend of the country's uniformed despot Gen. Sani Abacha, he benefited from some extremely profitable business arrangements during the years of dictatorship but was later compelled, after an investigation of his transactions, to return an estimated $300 million to the Nigerian treasury in exchange for a plea-bargaining arrangement by which his bank accounts could be unfrozen.

Well, not so fast.  Why did you suppose that is?  

&gt;The rating is based on annual federal tax documents. It was not intended to reflect whether Hillary Clinton kept donors to her family's foundation at appropriate arm's length or provided favored access as secretary of state.

**Sexual McCarthyism:**

&gt;Dick Morris, CNBC: Under Betsey Wright's supervision in the 1992 Clinton campaign, there was an entire operation funded with over $100,000 of campaign money, which included federal matching funds, to hire private detectives to go into the personal lives of women who were alleged to have had sex with Bill Clinton. To develop compromising material - black-mailing information, basically - to coerce them into signing affidavits saying they did not have sex with Bill Clinton.

&gt;Jarrett Stern, a private investigator, told ABC News in an interview broadcast last night that he was hired for an unspecified project by Landow, a wealthy Maryland developer who has raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for Clinton-Gore campaigns. Stern's lawyer, Edouard Bouquet of Bethesda, told the network his client felt uneasy about what he was asked to do and called Willey, using an alias, to warn her someone was out to do her harm.

...

&gt;Stern declined to detail what he had been asked to do in connection with Willey, but he told ABC that he ""wholeheartedly"" believes that Willey was approached with a menacing message by a stranger jogging near her Richmond home two days before her Jones case testimony. Willey has said the man inquired about her children by name, about her missing cat and about whether she'd gotten the tires on her car repaired after they were mysteriously vandalized by someone who drove masses of nails into all four of them. ""Don't you get the message?"" she has said the man asked.

&gt;Much of the income Hubbell received in 1994 came from contracts arranged by close friends and supporters of the Clintons, suggesting to investigators that Hubbell may have been given money to discourage him from cooperating with the Whitewater independent counsel's office.



&gt;The income Hubbell received in 1994 included $100,000 from a company controlled by the Riadys, the wealthy Indonesian family that has long been close to Clinton, and $62,775 from Revlon in a job arranged by Vernon Jordan, another close friend of Clinton. Jordan also helped to arrange a job at Revlon for Monica Lewinsky, the former White House intern whose relationship with Mr. Clinton is under investigation by the independent counsel's office. That job offer was withdrawn when the investigation about the relationship became public.

""](http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1999-07-14/news/9907140003_1_alfonso-fanjul-president-clinton-florida-democratic-party)

&gt;The Fanjul gathering, instigated by Florida Democratic Party Chairman Charles Whitehead and Miami lawyer Chris Korge, also showed the access that money can buy in politics. Fanjul's family owns Flo-Sun Inc. in Palm Beach County. Flo-Sun, one of the nation's largest producers of raw sugar, receives $65 million a year in federal subsidies.

...

&gt;Fanjul's dumped the greatest quantity of phosphorus waste into the Everglades, and having paid the heaviest fines for maltreating black stoop laborers from the Dominican Republic ($375,000) and for making illegal campaign contributions ($439,000). IN 1992, Alfonso was Florida's financial co-chairman for the Clinton presidential campaign.

I can't show you my votes, but I've been a registered independent since 43 ran for office. I was a Republican previous to that, and missed the race between 41 and 42 because I was deployed at the time and forgot to get my absentee ballot in.

That aside, I've never ideologically been a democrat or a republican, I'm a conservative libertarian, but not even libertarians took Johnson/Weld seriously. Just because McCain and Romney got votes doesn't mean that everyone that voted for Trump voted for them.

Romney is the hands off executive class of America, his business acumen was poor and largely just everything about him put me ill at ease, he was too white, too clean cut, too built for politics and I think my exact Facebook post when Obama won was something along the lines of ""This is great, now we don't have to explain our President's fake religion to the rest of the world."".

John McCain isn't a President, nor will he ever be in my opinion, whatever McCain was once, hes a political animal now and hes shifted positions too many times for me to ever be comfortable with him in public office, but I don't have a vote in Arizona so my feelings are immaterial. I was hugely put off by the choice to run Sarah Palin alongside him.....who I felt was largely just put in place as MILF eye candy to try to fool people into thinking the GOP was hip to the idea of women in leadership.

The reason insurance is becoming more expensive is because of something called single carrier markets, which is becoming more and more prevalent post Obamacare and you need do no more than talk to your local doctor about the havoc that has been wreaking within the medical establishment and the erosion of patient care quality since 2007. Currently, both myself via ACA, and myself, and all my employees via our company healthcare plan have one carrier to choose from for full medical care, and that company is Aetna, there is no other insurer currently operating in our region in the bulk market....and their costs are not only insanely high on their premiums, the deductibles are so high as to make paying the premium pointless anyways. Aside from major traumatic events, the insurer is almost literally never going to pay nothing out, on your individual level, because of the deductible.

Yeah I've gotten older, but my general health now is about the same as it was when I was in my 20's, I've got a little less hair but other than that, I certainly feel no different and my annual physicals (which I do at the VA because it costs me far less and is a requirement of maintaining my healthcare benefits with the VA) certainly don't indicate that my overall health has changed either, so I'm not suddenly looking at $600.00 premiums in 2017, after having a total monthly premium of $160.00 in 2016 because I'm suddenly a year older.

Obamacare has been a massive failure, thats the long and short of it. I'm all for everyone having healthcare, but I'm certainly not alongside of the idea of me having to pay the equivalent of two car payments for healthcare I can't use simply so people that have no financial means are able to go to the doctor....thats just not functionally fair and thats largely whats going on after all.

In 2009 - 2011 I went without medical insurance other than my VA coverage, I was running my own business at the time."

It's not a far stretch when people call for essentially taking from white people in various forms based on faulty theories (example being the STEM field problem presented by another commenter) and then silencing and shaming white people who would defend with reason that which they have in this life. It's also important to recognize that while we fight amongst our respective identity groups and blame one another for our problems, the people with the wealth and in control of the system that creates these problems are very very few in number and not at all representative of any identity group per se. They are selfish elites hoarding wealth and manipulating the nation to their advantage, and we fight over their scraps. It would be much more efficient to direct our efforts toward those systemic problems and to the elites who benefit from them than to the citizens who simply inherit the respective advantages or disadvantages within the system. I almost imagine it like a cartoon where we're all sitting together in a cage, hungry and pissed off, and our captor comes by and tosses a crumb of bread from his feast to few white people and the prisoners then resent and hate the entire white race as a response."

423479,0,"I understand that lots of people perceive it that way. But reality works differently.

Here's an ELI5 description. Economies are critically affected by business decisions, which can be broken down into two types:

* Expansion: hiring, construction, investing in new projects, and expanding into new markets.

* Contraction: firing, downsizing, cutting projects, and contracting markets.

We measure our economic health in terms of growth - which most plainly means: companies making more expansive decisions than contractionary decisions. It's really just the straight-up sum of all of the choices of all the companies.

And each company, in turn, bases its decisions by forecasting about the future. If taxes or interest rates are likely to fall, domestic and foreign demand is likely to rise, and its own costs are likely to fall - then the company will make expansive choices. And the opposite is true: if the future looks grim, each company will make contractionary choices.

Companies don't make these decisions by *looking back*. If the *last* quarter was good but the *next* quarter looks bad, the company will contract, not expand.

tl;dr - business choices are a leading indicator of national economic health, not a lagging indicator.

I understand that lots of people don't get this - or mis-portray it for political expedience or business reasons. It does, after all, make for a convenient cover story. But it doesn't match reality."

&gt;The Supreme Court will not allow North Carolina in the November election to use its strict voting law that a lower court found was enacted “with almost surgical precision” to blunt the influence of African American voters.


...
&gt;The panel seemed to say it found the equivalent of a smoking gun. “Before enacting that law, the legislature requested data on the use, by race, of a number of voting practices,” Motz wrote. “Upon receipt of the race data, the General Assembly enacted legislation that restricted voting and registration in five different ways, all of which disproportionately affected African Americans.”



Or places like Wisconsin who have funky ass hours of operation for ID offices in minority areas like ""Only open on the 5th wednesday of each month""

Or minority and poor areas not having enough polling locations so lines are just long as hell. 

Or minorities being systemically purged from voter rolls and people doing it bragging about it. 

You can dismiss it all you want, but this is an issue. And it should outrage everyone.  Sure, it may not be *literally* impossible for minorities to vote, but in a lot of cases it certainly is overly inconvenient. And the reality is when it's inconvenient they're less likely to do it. Different sections of the population should not have a disadvantage to something as basic as access to voting.

You know, you're going for an appeal to history regarding the Russian claim, but that's not really the case. It's true that Crimea wasn't Ukrainian before internal borders of USSR were drawn, but a sizeable portion of what is now Russia was. Russia didn't return it. They just took something new. And you know, Crimea used to be Ottoman for much longer anyway. Should Erdogan force the claim? 

Regardless, Russia confirmed these borders in, among other things, the Budapest memorandum. They also committed to not disrupting said borders in exchange for Ukraine getting rid of its nuclear stockpile. 

That's a very dangerous message to the world, isn't it? ""No nukes? No say.""

Your analogies don't stick very well, because you're picking parts of the USA. If you want the situation to be comparable, you need to pick another sovereign country - I think the Philippines would do nicely.

Again, there was no evidence she committed a crime, and again, she never intentionally mishandled the classified info. You say intent doesn't matter here, well to the DOJ it did. Mostly what it amounted too is Clinton lied, and while there was apparently classified information, none of it was ""intentionally mishandled"" and  thus no charges were filed. The main point here is most of the information [wasn't even classified at the time](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/aug/01/hillary-clinton/hillary-clintons-wrong-claim-fbi-director-comey-ca/).    
   
Not defending her as being okay, what she did was stupid. But what is going on currently with the administration is even worse. When the Senior Adviser to the ""President"" goes on National television and threatens the Courts power, and tells the Nation that Trumps power ""will not be questioned"".     
    
That's a shit ton more pressing and concerning than 2000 emails that were retroactively made classified information, after the fact she had them on her servers. In total, 113 were classified, with only three actually marked as being classified. More did have top-classified information on them, and should have been stored using Government computers I don't argue that. But again, what went on there doesn't remotely compare to the Trump administration. Hillary looks straight as an arrow compared to everything that's happening with Trump right now."

Of course they all had the same totalitarian structure, so now every argument about that can't get beyond someone spouting the no true Scotsman fallacy and ""history proves they always end up as totalitarian dictatorships!!!!""

I think we need to take a different approach incorporating many ideas and presenting the goal we are seeking, not on the problems of the current world we live in which people are well aware of, even if not down to a deep level. That foundation needs to be there, but I think people are more hopeful of something that's fleshed out. 

More income and social equality, less focus on work for the sake of work and pointless technological progress (more junk to buy if you have money), far more nature oriented, as sustainable as possible (reducing waste rather than aimply maintaining the status quo and recycling), stronger focus on medicine, research, science, decisions are made in a different system than electing parties, but one that can't be manipulated by nefarious groups to get people to act against their own self interests."

438067,0,"&gt; Can I believe, as the article suggests, that some protestors were rigging propane tanks for god knows what purpose, something went wrong, and they're willing to lie about that for media attention or actually believe the police were somehow at fault? Yep.

So you're more willing to believe the protesters are lying, even though you've admitted you don't have the information.

&gt; Um, kind of sounds like the protesters might have had something to do with those burned vehicles being on the bridge. Also, it's not their place to go clear those vehicles.

Once again, people are saying this of both sides.  YOU have put it on the protesters.

&gt; If I go start a bunch of ""peaceful bonfires"" on the land around a public highway/bridge with a significant police presence, I expect I'll get arrested. Frankly, I expect I committed some sort of crime, actually.

The fact that you put ""peaceful bonfire"" in quotes, just proves you're VERY biased.  So yeah, you've already made your decisions, and are trying to put in token statements to try and make it seem as if you're weighing both sides equally.  You're not.  You're on the polices side and if something goes wrong you ASSume it's the protesters at fault.

It's implied within the 4th Amendment, but not explicitly stated, and taxes are a gray area. These aren't ""your"" records, so much as the governments ON you that you're required to fill out.  Not to mention they were previously public, so I think it's clearly established that's a legal practice.

The vast majority of Americans use private entities to fill out their taxes (mostly thanks to the lobbies of said entities fucking with the tax code to keep themselves in business), so privacy is already out the window. Or have we not yet learned about what happens to private info in the hand of large corporations? 

I'm not sure why taxes are inherently private anyways, they would seem to me to be the opposite. Your right to have everything your way ends when it meets the free market, it's not as free as the name belies.

470972,0,"Oh man. You don't know anything about police work.

What are:

Motives - People don't kill people randomly usually. If you wanted me dead there would 9 times out of 10 be a reason. Motive is one of the best tools police have, and one of the first things they establish. They would ask, do you know this man? Have you met this man? They would interview my friends and family. I might have said ""i'm going to see a friend"", or ""I just met this guy i'm going to his house"" Any slip in that turns your story upside down. What actions led you to kill me? Did I threaten you? With what? A gun? Where's the gun? Where the weapon? He physically threatened you? With what? Did he hit you? Was there a struggle? You'd have to establish my motive for violence as well.

Alibi - You'd need to prove where you were, you'd also need to prove that I came there randomly. That can be difficult. Especially with GPS.

Crime scene - I would be unarmed. That would perplex investigators. Why would I come into your house unarmed? Why was there no struggle? Where did you shoot me? What motive do I have to harm you? How could your story explain away all these inconsistencies? You realize I have GPS on my phone? 

&gt;ND THEN you have a law that gives him basically blanket immunity.

If the conditions are right.

Not in this way it isn't. This has been studied in Brazil, which is pretty similar to the US, and the average partisan voter (left or right) actually has a sub-100 IQ.

In the US, social conservative views correlate negatively with IQ. The average (R) voter has a higher IQ than the average (D) voter. But in the upper quantiles where every one is a PhD or MD, it becomes almost all (D) voters. You can easily take one of these facts + some smugness and delude yourself into thinking that your party is smarter than the other, but the truth is that **both parties appeal largely to stupid people**. (Note that I am not arguing that both party platforms are equally stupid.)

Hillary didn't win her primary with nuanced and detailed policy positions. She won with name recognition, celebrity, and politicking. I doubt 2% of (D) voters read her policy positions in any detail."

Most of your points is putting Barrett's words into Baraka mouth, simply because Baraka was interviewed by him.

But let's look at it again:

&gt; Ajamu Baraka called President Obama an ""Uncle Tom"" because Obama condemned the violence and riots during the Ferguson protests.

Lie. Here is what Baraka [said](http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/17/politics/jill-stein-ajamu-baraka-green-party-town-hall/):

""Obama had an historic opportunity to transform this country.""
""He allowed his commitment to neoliberal policies and a neoliberal worldview to undermine the possibility of greatness""

&gt; Ajamu Baraka called Bernie Sanders ""media-driven pseudo-opposition"" whose voters are implicitly supporting white supremacy.

Lie. He called Sanders out for not being critical of [Eurocentrism](http://www.ajamubaraka.com/the-yemen-tragedy-and-the-ongoing-crisis-of-the-left-in-the-united-states/) in the aftermath of Yemen events and MSM blackout.

&gt; Ajamu Baraka believes that assimilating black people into the US middle class is ""genocide.""

If you bothered to provide context, than you would clearly see that he was talking about [*cultural*](http://www.counterpunch.org/2016/02/11/beyonce-and-the-politics-of-cultural-dominance/) ""genocide"".

&gt; Ajamu Baraka suspected that the murder of 3 Israeli teenagers by Hamas was a ""false flag"" perpetrated by Israel.

You are twisting his words. He said that his *theory* is that they were supposed to be kidnapped, but *not* murdered.

&gt; Ajamu Baraka believes that the US played a role in creating the ISIS ""boogeyman"" so that it can invade Iraq and seize its natural gas resources.

He said that US was turning the blind eye to ISIS when Iraq was asking for assistance with weapons in order to deal with ISIS themselves. US have already been in Iraq. Several times.

&gt; Ajamu Baraka agrees with Russia that Bashar al-Assad's presidency is legitimate.

Baraka simply lists evidence that there is indeed a popular support for Assad and criticizes US media for not covering it. Why do you bring Russia into it? Do you have an agenda perhaps?

&gt; Ajamu Baraka agrees with Russia that the MH17 attack was a ""false flag"" perpetrated by Ukraine.

No he does not. He said there was a theory put forward some time before the accident that there may be false flag operation like that and that accident happened, and the media did very uncritical coverage, immediately blaming it on Russia, without considering that Ukraine had similar weaponry.

&gt; Ajamu Baraka suspected that reports about the Boko Haram kidnappings were exaggerated.

Nice choice of omitted words. He said that due to lack of details (names/photos), the *numbers* may be exaggerated. But what he is really talking about is media overly focusing on the tragedy, and failing to put it into context of ""the destabilization, death and destruction unleashed across Africa from the Sahel into West Africa as a result of one historic event – the vicious NATO obliteration of the state of Libya."" Again, he criticizes biased media coverage.

&gt; Ajamu Baraka called the Charlie Hebdo vigils a ""white power march"". 

It happened on the same weekend as [""2,000 Nigerians may have lost their lives at the hands of Boko Haram""](http://dissidentvoice.org/2015/01/the-charlie-hebdo-white-power-rally-in-paris/), and all Baraka was saying is that expressions of solidarity with the survivors in Nigeria was ostensibly missing from rally in Paris.

BTW, nice attempt you made at portraying Baraka as an apologist for Boko Haram. 

&gt; Ajamu Baraka has appeared at least 4 times on the radio show of Kevin Barrett, a conspiracy theorist, Holocaust denier, and 9/11 truther.

That's pretty much the only thing that is half-true in your list. He appeared on this show, and what you are doing is basically putting Barrett's words into Baraka's mouth. Also, if I recall correctly, Holocaust denying accusation against Barrett was pretty far fetched (you are basically equating saying that some people in Ukraine collaborated with Nazis with holocaust denying).

&gt; Ajamu Baraka's article about Charlie Hebdo was included in Barrett's book, which argued that the November 2015 Paris attacks were a ""false flag"" perpetrated by the CIA and Mossad.

Again, are you putting Barett's words into Braka's mouth? Because Baraka did not say those things in his [article](http://www.ajamubaraka.com/the-charlie-hebdo-white-power-rally-in-paris-a-celebration-of-western-hypocrisy/)

Well said; it's imperative that the prejudices on both sides are exposed so the people may collectively try to mitigate them.

&gt;Lets just call it even and say that its a wash both ways.

While I agree that there's prejudice both ways, I don't think it's necessarily equal.

I'll preface this following statement by saying liberals tend to have an air of smugness about them when it comes to claiming the moral high ground. With that said, I think propping up Obama because he's black is more innocuous than propping up Trump because he defends whites, or as some see it, antagonizes minorities.

At the end of the day, my main gripe with Trump and the majority of his supporters here is that he clearly appealed to racists throughout his campaign and only few of them want to call it like it is."

I am absolutely not doing that. I was using the population of Mexico as a benchmark.

&gt;We deport millions every year.

No, we don't. [In 2014 (the last year for which data is available), there were 414,481 removals.](https://www.dhs.gov/yearbook-immigration-statistics-2014-enforcement-actions) For that same year, 162,814 people who were either inadmissable or deportable left the country without an order of removal (meaning they did so of their own volition). Obama's deportation number is significantly higher than every other previous president. So no, we do not ""deport millions every year.""

&gt;Given enough time we will eventually deport 650 million people from our country (if it hasn't been done already).

Since 1892, the US government has deported 7,070,141. That includes repeats. Since 1927. the number of voluntary returns (meaning people who could have been deported, but weren't) was 47,918,724. Over nearly 100 years, we haven't even gotten to a tenth of that, and we only get to nearly a tenth by including people who *weren't deported*.

&gt;Given enough time we will also have 650 million immigrants.

Sure, but now you're conflating ""immigrants"" with ""illegal immigrants."" 

&gt; I see more fallacy in Trump's time frame than in his actual numbers of immigrants

Despite the fact that it has zero basis in reality and would require everyone living south of the Texas border to immigrate simultaneously. Ok. Good times.

&gt;Also, even if not every single immigrant gets deported 6 times, there are many that have been. This is fact.

334283,0,"The problem is that Trump said he favors the pre-existing coverage stuff, but wants to get rid of the fines/mandate.

That's not going to happen. You're adding thousands of high risk people to a pool and then slashing the funding for it.

Most people don't realize that Obamacare costs skyrocketed because Republican states rejected federal funding and the individual mandate had not kicked in yet. The penalties were not being levied.  People simply weren't buying enough insurance to offset the higher numbers of high risk participants. However, when the mandate kicked in, revenue would have increased due to ""fines"" and increased enrollment. 

If you think costs are high now, wait until we force companies to keep pre-existing coverage and then kill a huge source of revenue. Prices will skyrocket or companies will simply go bankrupt.

People also forget that Obamacare forced the digitization of what was largely a disorganized clusterfuck paper operation. Digitizing medical data/records makes it easier to share and access, essentially helping modernize the entire industry. The DoD was way ahead of the private sector when it started building MHSi, or the Military Health System Intranet. Tricare, Army, Navy, Air Force, and the Coast Guard's medical services all running on a shared and completely digitized information network. Walter Reed, the president's hospital, runs on this network.

447718,0,"Take a look into the recount laws. 

To force a recount in PA (on the only grounds Hillary can) you must be within the Close Vote Margin: 
Less than or equal to .5%

To force a recount in MI, you can demand a recount at an time but must pay per precinct unless they lost by less than .5 %

The entire deposit is refunded if the recount reverses the result of the elections. Mich. Comp. Laws 168.867(5) and 168.881(5). However, the cost per precinct increases to $125 per precinct when the margin of victory is more than 50 votes or 0.5% of the total number of votes cast (or, in the case of multi-candidate contests, 0.5% of the sum of the number of votes received by the petitioner and the winning candidate with the fewest votes), whichever is greater.  Mich. Comp. Laws 168.867(2) and (3) and 168.881(2) and (3).


To force in WI, you must justify WHY you want the recount to a board. They can reject at this point. Assuming Hillary got it accepted, she would need to pay a filing fee for each precinct (in this case, nearly every precinct bar 1.)

No fee is required if the difference between the leading candidate and those cast for the petitioner of 

between the affirmative and negative votes cast at a referendum is 0.25% or less. If the difference is
greater than 0.25%, a filing fee is required.

Example: scenario #1: Village President
Candidate Votes
A 4,500
B 4,450
In this scenario, candidate A would currently be elected to office. If a recount was requested,
the fee is determined by first calculating the total votes cast for the office (4,500+4,450 =
8,950). The difference between the leading candidate and the petitioner (50 votes) is divided
by the total votes cast (8,950) and then multiplied by 100 to get the percentage difference
(0.56%).

Obviously as seen here: http://www.electionreturns.pa.gov/ENR_NEW

She is not within the .5% difference required to force a recount, thus the PA recount cannot be forced.

736221,0,"&gt; Garland not having a vote is a de facto rejection of his nomination.

*Technically* not having a vote is a vote of confidence, not no-confidence. Obama did actually have the legal standing to just appoint him, because the constitution doesn't explicitly state that he *has to be confirmed*, only that he must consult with the senate. Them not voting for almost a year was perfectly able to be taken as a sign of not contesting the appointment, and IMO he should have just put him in.

&gt; Would it have made you feel better if the theatrics of holding a hearing took place and the same result was reached?

Yes, because *that's how politics should work*. If they had the numbers and the actual logical arguments to not approve him, they should have used him. But because Obama played them by literally nominating the guy they said he's never be brave enough to do, they realized they had no standing and couldn't face an actual vote. 

&gt; Like I said, Republicans gambled on a better pick should the 2016 elections go their way.

You and I apparently disagree on how the government should work them. The US people elected Obama by a large margin knowing that he may have to appoint a Sup Court nominee during his tenure. It was the republican Senate's job to comply with that and hold a vote, not pussy fut around and delay long enough to get another chance at winning."

Sort of. It's the very most *fundamental* aspect of democracy, bar none.

""This is the first nation in the world that was ever established on the basis of reason instead of simply warfare. These were eighteenth-century deists, these gentlemen. Over here we read, 'In God We Trust.' But that is not the god of the Bible. These men did not believe in a Fall. They did not think the mind of man was cut off from God. The mind of man, cleansed of secondary and merely temporal concerns, beholds with the radiance of a cleansed mirror a reflection of the rational mind of God. Reason puts you in touch with God. Consequently, for these men, there is no special revelation anywhere, and none is needed, because the mind of man cleared of its fallibilities is sufficiently capable of the knowledge of God. All people in the world are thus capable because all people in the world are capable of reason. All men are capable of reason. That is the fundamental principle of democracy. Because everybody's mind is capable of true knowledge, you don't have to have a special authority, or a special revelation telling you that this is the way things should be."" - New York Professor Joseph Campbell, 1986, interviewed at Skywalker Ranch

John Brown, convicted of treason against the Commonwealth of Virginia in 1859 and executed for attempting to organize armed resistance to slavery.


Aaron Dwight Stevens, took part in John Brown's raid and was executed in 1860 for treason against Virginia.


William Bruce Mumford, convicted of treason and hanged in 1862 for tearing down a United States flag during the American Civil War.


Walter Allen was convicted of treason on September 16, 1922 for taking part in the 1921 Miner's March with the coal companies and the US Army on Blair Mountain, West Virginia. He was sentenced to 10 years and fined. During his appeal to the Supreme Court he disappeared while out on bail.

[1-7.000 - Media Relations](https://www.justice.gov/usam/usam-1-7000-media-relations#1-7.500) outlines all of this for you on how they are to conduct their comments to anyone outside of the DOJ during ongoing investigations. 

&gt;Providing an update to Congress about it

Considering that the FBI doesn't report their findings to Congress, only the DOJ, they have specific policies in place during an election that they have to adhere to that would prevent the FBI from even *appearing* to be politicized, which you can read [here](https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/ag/legacy/2009/02/10/ag-030508.pdf). He would have to report to the Public Integrity Section of the Justice Department in oder to precede with how to deal with the new information. Now, I'll grant you that Dir. Comey would have to notify Congress if he had to change his statement that he gave about the investigation but this would be only if he *had* to. And he can present case information to Congress *after* the case has been made but not during the investigation process; again, it creates a political conflict of interest appearance. 

&gt;You don't think its part of the FBI's job to communicate privately with Congress?

No, that's the Attorney General's job. He says in his own [letter](http://www.mediaite.com/online/heres-the-letter-james-comey-sent-to-fbi-employees-explaining-clinton-letter/) to the FBI that he knew he was making a statement that was going to have ""significant risk of being misunderstood"" in a situation where ""we don't ordinarily tell Congress about ongoing investigations"", meaning that he had no clue how or if the evidence was relevant to the case or his original statement in a situation that the Department doesn't normally engage in. Factual or not, his statement gave the *appearance* of a partisan stance of the FBI which, again, is a big no-no. 

&gt;If it turns out there's literally ZERO connection, I'll be on your side.

Thus she was forced to withdraw her court petition for a Pennsylvania recount. That doesn’t mean it’s over, of course, only that there is now another legal hurdle to fight.

68558,0,"It's just that the Supreme Court likes Alexander Hamilton. They've cited him more than any of the other Founding Fathers because he wrote most of the Federalist papers, and probably because he generally was a fan of the judicial branch, despite his (deserved) reputation of being in love with the executive branch.

Faithless electors aren't going to take the presidency from Trump. But if they did, the Court would probably uphold their actions to be perfectly constitutional.

It should be noted that the idea of electors being independent, intellectual agents wasn't just Hamilton's idea. This is one of the reasons basically everyone liked the electoral college: everyone thought, ""wow, that seems really great, we won't ever elect a tyrant this way!"" and it was one of the only parts of the Constitution he didn't have to fight for.

Except, the place where this gets really, really interesting is that Alexander Hamilton was a believer in the living Constitution ~~which sounds really cultish, oops.~~ He thought that the spirit of the Constitution was a thing that could be interpreted and could, potentially, change. So if he were around today ~~on a helluva lot of medication because the man was bipolar and having a severe manic depressive episode when he died and resurrection would probably drive the already traumatized guy insane~~ he might even admit: the electors don't have the power people thought they would when the Constitution was first written."

&gt; This is a radical departure from President Obama's current policy.

&gt; Mr Trump has offered no further details on his plans but he has hinted in the past that he favoured an expansion of the nuclear programme.

&gt; He was asked in interviews whether he would use weapons of mass destruction against an enemy and he said that it would be an absolute last stance, but he added that he would want to be unpredictable.

&gt; In contrast, President Obama has talked of the US commitment to seek peace and security without nuclear weapons.

&gt; He has sought to reduce the nation's arsenal of nearly 5,000 warheads in favour of more special operations forces and precise tactical strikes. 

That's a misleading way to characterize Obama's impact. Sure, he said very nice things, but he recently approved a $1 trillion (Edit: I think - kept looking for source where I heard this number and could not find it. But it is is in the trillions over decades) program to ""modernize"" US nuclear arsenal.

Modernization is a good thing, right? Well, they are going to develop next generation weapons and, I believe, the ""precise tactical strikes"" refers to the fact that they will be smaller and more ""precise"" i.e. there will be more of a temptation to use them in ""regular"" wars. This is essentially just setting in motion another round of the nuclear arms race because the Russians absolutely will not be cool with this. 

[Why President Obama is moving ahead with the biggest modernization of US nuclear weapons in decades](https://www.wbez.org/shows/the-takeaway/why-president-obama-is-moving-ahead-with-the-biggest-modernization-of-us-nuclear-weapons-in-decades/1acc7912-0f8f-4468-a505-58a71cbb18ef)"

455729,0,"The problem is that the pipeline was already rerouted.  The initial plan had it running right by Bismarck and white people became worried that it would endanger their drinking water so they rerouted and went through tribal lands instead.

Now they have the protest at Standing Rock.  They could reroute past the current tribe but they'd just be on the lands of another tribe that is active in the current protest.  It goes that way until you eventually hit another white community that will ask why it has to go right through the city.

The developer also built most of the pipeline before all the permits were obtained.  It's very expensive to redesign if one of the permits doesn't go through.  As far as I'm concerned that's the developer's problem.  But you can see why they have a boom or bankrupt interest in making sure they get that last permit.

380315,0,"&gt; If you think being gay is a choice, you're most likely bisexual.

Or you're religious and believe sin isn't defined by attraction but rather by action. The Christians that proclaim gay sex to be wrong also tend to consider heterosexual sex wrong a lot of the time. Sodomy is generally frowned upon regardless. Sex outside of marriage is forbidden. Engaging in sodomy or 'pre-marital' sex is a choice, as is engaging in gay sex.

I don't know how this gets overlooked so consistently. When the religious right says 'being gay is a choice', they mean 'having sex with people of your gender is a choice'. When gay rights groups say 'being gay is not a choice', they mean being attracted to people of your gender is not a choice."

And when you get that job, that's what you'll be called if you're not working the register or drive thru. Fry cook. You might even have a pay difference; you see this in retail all the time. My girlfriend works retail, and her official applicant position hasn't changed but she's less formally a merchandise handler who makes $2.50 more than regular retail. 

You also don't take into account local chains for fast food. I worked at Mediterranean Sandwich Co. here and the cooks were most definitely called cooks. It was non-traditional fast food but it's still fast food. I can imagine tons of places have similar situations. 

But if we're going by what the employer strictly calls their positions, I suppose you only call Subway workers ""sandwich artists,"" yeah? 

And the truth is that minimum wage was designed to provide for a person and a family if they worked full time. Fast food workers don't deserve that.

Conservatives want less government straight up. Anything they can do to reduce government will be done. There are certain things that they want to keep, and this is where the difference between normal conservativism and libertarianism comes in, the amount. (the main difference is that libertarians generally don't care about enforcing morals on others.)

Liberals on the other hand, don't want larger government *per se*. They have certain goals (safety net, education accessible to all) and recognize that government is, in most cases, the most effective way to reach these goals everywhere in the country. If it were truly more effective to rely on other sources for these goals, liberals would switch in a heartbeat."

There is no reason why the next step in our healthcare system couldn't be a public option to help further reduce costs.

These claims are dangerous to democracy. 

Whenever anything negative is said about Clinton however, it is instantly buried in thus sub. And fwiw, Republicans do have a plan to replace Obamacare if you bothered to Google it. This is one of the main reasons I will be voting for Trump- our current system is leading to exponentially greater costs and less competition and less choice.

Trump can't be stopped before he locks the world into irreparable damage (and possibly WWIII) unless the Republicans DO THEIR FUCKING JOBS and repudiate Trump.

However, the Party has consistently shown over the past few years that hoping Republicans will do the right thing is like hoping a pig will grow wings and fly.

Civil discourse is being shut down and ignored by the Trump Administration. They hold all the political keys and have proven that with gerrymandering, voter suppression and electoral wrangling they don't even need popular support.

314389,0,"Bill Clinton himself said, ""Democrats fall in love. Republicans fall in line."" It's a statement that I've been thinking a lot about every time Hillary made another awkward, robotic campaign appearance. It was certainly ringing in my ears on Tuesday night.

The republicans fell in line. Many of them flat out didn't like Trump, but saw Clinton as an even worse threat. Democrats, however, simply didn't fall in love. Clinton's major message was, ""Better than him!"" and with all the negativity and fallout from the primaries it just wasn't enough to energize Dems.

I was a Bernie supporter but also one of the first to ""get on board"" when Clinton got the nom. We'll never know how Sanders would have done, no need to even bother with the argument but in June we were staring at a terrible choice: **the two most unpopular candidates in modern history.** Add to that all the negativity and of course a lot of people just wanted to skip it.

And just to say: I honestly think Clinton means well and would likely be a better president than Trump. But - rightly or wrongly (I think mostly wrongly) - that woman has had a target painted on her back for the last 30 years. Hindsight is 20/20, but looking back  it was insane and hubris-tic to think that wasn't a major red flag.
""But the scandals are all lies! A right wing conspiracy!"" Maybe. But you've also got a portion of the country thinking Obama is a secret Muslim.

 ""Bringing Facts to a culture war is like bringing a knife to a gun fight."" - I forget who said that, but it's another statement that's been ringing in my ears. Clinton needed to inspire to rise above the baggage her brand had, and she never really did. She certainly didn't appeal to the poor and broken people who have watched politicians fuck them over year after year.

It's funny but a week ago - when I was so sure she would win - I was having conversation with my friends about all the ""crazies"" who would be voting Trump. ""But they're not all crazy racist biggots. They're people who are so desperate for change they'll burn down the country. When Trump loses they'll still be there, still mad. We have to hear they're voices.""

Fake news would be someone saying, ""Florida fell into the ocean today."" with no sources. It didn't happen. 

When the NYTimes runs a story that says, ""The white house is in chaos"", then has up to a dozen different sources from inside the white house that all corroborate that, how is that fake news? It's perfectly valid news and not fake, and not lying. It's just something Trump and his supporters don't want to hear.

So Trump is merely using ""fake news"" to broadly challenge any report against him, he should be using the words, ""false news"" meaning that the sources are wrong, not fake.

Do you suppose they're still going to be happy with the $20/hr they work their ass off for? Not really, so you're going to have inflation of the dollar until you end up at the same place.

And all that's going to do is force more people into poverty, because at twice the current min, McDonalds would fire all their people and start dumping money into automation. There's no sustainable way to give the guy making your McChicken $20/hr, and at that point it becomes cheaper to fire him and get a computer to do it. The guy making your McChicken shouldn't be trying to support a family on that wage. Not every single job *should* give enough to support a family on, that's what teenagers are for.

You want the real answer? Start making it easier for people to learn these marketable skills so they can earn they money they need. Subsidise it, make it so they don't have to go way into debt to learn it. Better yet, give them some temporary help while they're going to school so they don't need 3 jobs to take care of their family and don't have enough time to learn things. But that shouldn't be super easy to get, you should have to be in a program that's approved so that they know the job market will be good when you get out and that you'll actually end up with a job rather than right back at the McDonalds.

**Edit:** I'd like to add that this very much includes trade school. Learning to be a plumber, or an electrician, or a welder, these are all areas that need people and pay a lot better than your local burger joint. Plus they give you the freedom to either start your own trade and *really* go for that American dream, or go for the stability and work for someone else at a much higher wage than minimum.

Conservatives, happy, because that means no minimum wage increases, and more people making taxable amounts of money means more people paying taxes instead of paying nothing, and that's huge for our defecit. Liberals, happy, because that means better education for our country and less people in poverty."

If two attorneys are scheduled for a status conference in front of a judge regarding the completion of discovery, it's pretty common for one attorney to file something prior to the hearing notifying the court of the status of the discovery production.  That's what this is.

I have no idea what would be illegal about this exchange, as it is the type of exchange that happens pretty regularly.

So, if you could point me to the law that makes this ""100% illegal"", I would appreciate it.  Thanks in advance."

not sure how it is in the UK, but in the US the food industry actively fights to keep this quiet and controls the food supply itself.

this is completely independent of the healthcare system, but as they say an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.

&gt;I mean, I realize it wasn't your intention, but consider that your post basically reads like ""women should have to put up with men making them feel potentially unsafe, because the man might have his feelings hurt if she rejects him."" 

Right, which is why the very next sentence after what you quoted was, ""And no, obviously that's not fair to you and obviously it doesn't justify harassment or violence."" Funny how actually reading the entire post can make a difference, isn't it? And then the next sentence after *that* was, ""But before you start talking about male tears or poor man feels, consider that in the UK, suicide is now the leading cause of death among men age 20 to 49."" Yes, those silly men, always getting their feelings hurt. They don't understand what *real* suffering is like, amirite?

&gt;Congratulations, you've just described one major aspect of toxic masculinity. Our social pressure to tie ourselves to our sexual history and ability to ""conquer"" is a huge fucking problem. 

This is a misunderstanding that I see from feminists all the time. Basically, you've got it backwards. Success doesn't come from sleeping with lots of women, sleeping with lots of women comes from success. The narrative goes that successful men are attractive, and unattractive men must be losers. Sleeping with lots of women is a way to demonstrate that you're attractive and therefore successful, but it's not the only way. You could also marry an attractive woman, for example. The important thing to note is that this is an *internal* judgement more than an external one. A man who isn't successful with women thinks, ""There must be something wrong with me. I must be a loser."" And even if he completely hides that aspect of himself from the outside world, and all of his peers think he's successful, he still judges *himself*. 

So, are feminists responsible for society being this way? No, of course not. But they sure aren't helping matters, either. Here's a little experiment for you. Go on /r/TheBluePill, for example, and count up how many comments you can find on the front page implying that MRA's or redpillers or what have you are losers. Anything about neckbeards, fedoras, parents' basements, etc etc. See, *both sides* agree that if a guy can't get laid, it must be because he's some kind of loser, even if they mean completely different things by that."

&gt;Here’s a story that’s just breaking: It appears that the Trump campaign is filing a lawsuit against the Clark County Registrar’s Office for keeping polls open yesterday for two additional hours beyond their close time (this is being reported by CNN’s Jim Sciutto). It’s slightly confounding that they are doing so, since voters are allowed to cast ballots past the official poll closing time, as long as they were in line before the end official voting hours. As a Clark County spokesman said a couple of days ago, ““If there’s a line when closing time comes, we just keep processing voters until there’s no more line.”

While I'm inclined to agree, I think this discussion is complicated by the fact that few people really know what they (personally) mean when they use words like left/right/liberal/conservative. And it's obvious that most people *don't know* what voters on the other side *really want*.

(Due to disinformation spread by either party, everyone is now either a ""communist"" or a ""neonazi"". Those *exist*, certainly. But my 72 year old Colombian aunt isn't a neonazi; she's just a Republican whose upbringing emphasized the value of *owning land* but not things like *tolerance* or *racial equality*. And your 43 year old degree-less white brother-in-law isn't a communist; he's just a Democrat whose commitment to social justice led him to *also* accept some dishonest partisan propaganda about human capital, assets, market regulation, and the relationships between them. 

Ironically, our respective relatives could potentially lead each other to a better understanding of the things they misunderstand (about each other's views, and about the world). But The Two Parties have made such a conversation impossible by imbuing the words ""conservative"" and ""liberal"" with associations of extreme suspicion, disgust, moral outrage, proud ignorance, etc. If my aunt and your brother-in-law parked next to each other in a parking lot, civil discourse would die as soon as each noticed the other's bumper stickers. If anything, they might spew some cheap (and baseless) political insults; for anything beyond that, their monkey brains would be too busy fuming.)"

Says the healthcare plan you cannot afford is helping. The candidate visits your area in a limo surrounded by security. They give a canned speech. One point is talking about allowing more people in who have been undercutting your job. Another point is starting way with Russia.

 The Republican visits your area talking about how he will improve the economy. Says he will bring jobs back. How he will cut taxes. He will stop the inflow of cheap labor. Make peace with Russia.

You vote Republican.

The Democrat lost. They tell people how liberals need to flood these areas and the cycle continues.

Now let's apply the labor force participation rate (employed+unemployed) of 62.8% to that figure and we get 172,700.  That should give a rough estimate of the people counted for the first time as either employed or unemployed.  So, that means that 11,700 (7.26%) entrants are not employed though that does not necessarily mean that they are unemployed; the growth in the labor force may not have kept pace with the growth in population for a variety of reasons.

My point is that this figure does not mean that there are 161,000 fewer unemployed than there were the previous month, if anything it looks like there are slightly more.  Possible reasons for the slight decline in nominal unemployment rate include more former worker entering college and seasonal changes (both significant factors in Fall given new school years and the end of summer jobs/internships) but also more discouraged workers who are not counted as unemployed.  So, this figure is relatively close to a break-even point for employment rates (likely a little less) and hardly something to tout as an economic success story."

They're not going through Weiner's email. Rather, on Weiner's computer, they discovered email sent and received by Huma Abedin, Hillary's deputy chief of staff and vice campaign chair (and Weiner's ex-wife), from her personal account.

They didn't confiscate Weiner's laptop for this purpose; they were already looking through it in connection to Weiner's sexting case, and that's when they came across Hillary's assistant's emails.

And yes some of those jobs will disappear over time due to automation ofcourse. But you act like that person isnt an actual human that wants to earn enough to buy food and pay rent and bills. Just a number. Just a percentage of the population. 

Imagine you are a 50 year old doing unskilled labour. What if you lose your jobs because of it moving overseas? What will you do? You have no savings. You cant afford to study a new trade without a job. No company will give a student loan to a 50 year old. Say somehow you go through a couple years of learning. You apply for jobs. You are at the back of the queue for every job. No one wants to hire an older guy near retirement when theres already competition among young people. You end up again working a lower paying job but with huge debt from studying. 

Tell me now you wouldnt vote for someone that promises you some way out. 
Yes we knows he is lying. But when you are desperate and someone says things you want to hear, it blinds you from the truth. All you see is that as your way out.

Now you have this beacon of hope to cling on to, no matter how many times he is sexist or racist, you see this man as the only hope you have. 

Yes its selfish. But selflessness and doing whats best for everyone is a lot easier when you are in our position than those of a lot of Americans that voted this year. And if you discount the people that would always vote republican and always vote democrat. Its those few percent that made the difference. The few percent that are ignored for the greater good."

Second - we know that Trump actively tried to soften the US stance toward Russia both via his rhetoric and via his policy influence (Platform, etc.). And that Flynn also did so explicitly.

Third - We know that the Russians actively hacked the DNC and leaked emails at strategic points in an effort to tip the election for Trump.

Fourth - the only unproven piece of the puzzle is whether the discussions between Trump's top level staff and the Russians mention a quid pro quo deal. This is the smoking gun that results in an impeachment. 

Sure Congress can come up with a number of reason to impeach him. But a republican congress would only do so if all 4 of the above elements were proven, and the lack of an explicit quid pro quo agreement to provide favorable foreign policy in exchange for help with the election means that there isn't enough evidence for Trump to be impeached... yet"

But for the Presidential election? I don't see it. In fact, if you look at the typical break-down of how people vote, it tends to be more split along rural vs urban areas than it is regional. And so the result is that we have rural voters in California and urban voters in Texas, just as two examples, that both feel disaffected and impotent.

Of course, this issue is less of a problem in Congress since we have the House of Representatives. Although gerrymandering can still cause some problems there.

Anyway, I maintain that the problem with most states being predictable is quite tangible and obvious. While I completely agree with you on why politicians wouldn't waste their time ""preaching to the choir"", the result is that who they do talk to shapes our national conversation.

474466,0,"There are two separate processes at work here. 

1. Your eligibility to vote, which gets you on the voter rolls in the first place

2. Demonstrating your identity that you are in fact the person listed on the voter rolls.

&gt;first time voters can bring in a utility bill or many other pieces of extremely easily obtained docs that have nothing to do with proving their legal status to be in the US

When you come to vote for the first time after registration, and you bring a utility bill to verify your identity, your eligibility to vote and an on file signature must have already been determined through your DMV record and Social security number.

If you register without providing your DL number/signature demonstrating your eligibility (typically through your SSN) you will NOT yet be registered and you must provide proof of eligibility to get on the voter rolls.

From the very same website:  

""No matter how you turn in your registration application – online or on paper – when it comes to determining a person's eligibility to vote, preventing duplicate registrations, and adding a person to California's official voter rolls, all the same safeguards are in place. Your county elections official will contact you when your voter registration application is approved or when more information is needed to confirm your eligibility.""

It's not racist to merely be opposed to illegal immigration or suggest we should make sure people entering from violent and unstable parts of the world are searched for guns.

I do think there should be some ""ideological cleansing"" (as it's mocking called...) with in the Democratic Party though, the age of the Clinton wing and the big donors needs to go because they can't compete with Trump's brand of populism. We need Democratic politicians that are close knit with their local communities and support their interests on the national level (of course, with a left-wing bent as they are in the left wing party). They need to not fear being labeled ""liberal"" or ""progressive"" and remind people that those ""liberal"" ideas are exactly what they support. Same-sex marriage, abortion rights, marijuana legalization, raising the minimum wage, government reform, protectionist trade policies, etc. are all positions Democrats have majority support on, they need to stop cowarding in fear and start going on the offensive. And on issues where they don't have majority support, they need smart and charismatic politicians to go out and makes good arguments for them. Attacking the Republicans by calling them buzzwords doesn't work and pushes white voters towards the Republicans.

The campaign ad where the kids looked sad while watching Trump curse shows precisely the miscalculation the Democrats made. People didn't care enough about Trump's comments to vote solely on that issue alone, his economic populism and pro-protectionist policies are what they should have been attacking, they should have ran ads calling him out for outsourcing his own jobs, showing workers whose jobs were sent to fucking China and Veitnam and explaining why they're voting for Clinton, not ""Look at the naughty language!"", which in the end flopped spectacularly in the mid-west and lost her the election."

516319,0,"&gt;Okay, I (along with everyone who feels the same way) never vote for the Democrats again, but unless we all choose to vote for the same third party, that just means the Republicans always get elected and I consistently get the opposite of what I want.

I disagree. First of Obama has shown us that you don't get the opposite of what you want. In many ways his administration was even more conservative than Bush's. You get pretty much the same thing but slightly different in some ways. The last remaining argument was ""but he will select liberal judges to the supreme court"" and now even that's gone because no sane person would say Garland was a liberal judge.

&gt; Ignoring the absurd claim that Garland replacing Scalia swings the court to the right,

He could have swung the court to the left. He chose not to, he chose to keep the court conservative. Currently the court is split 50/50 and he is swinging it right with Garland.

&gt;But, really, there's no need to even discuss this if you would honestly suggest you'll get better Supreme Court nominees from Trump than Clinton (from the perspective of someone on the left) when Trump has released a list of possible nominees that are all absolutely awful. 

I am saying there won't be that much a difference. I have no faith Clinton would nominate liberal judges, she is more conservative than Obama on pretty much every topic.

&gt;Trump is unpredictable so maybe he'll do something better"" is an insane reason to not vote for Clinton.

Trump is insane so I'll vote for him so that things break and only by breaking things can we fix them is a pretty good reason."

BS on Democrats favoring military intervention for ""humanitarian goals"".  This is so far from reality I'm not even going to refute it by going over 24 years of middle east policy and Johnson escalating in Vietnam among many other things.

I would however encourage you read the ""Confronting Global Threats"" portion of the Democratic Party Platform.

193331,0,"To answer your first question:

1) Pro War: First off, more than half the country wanted to go to war after what happened. Clinton, and the rest who voted, voted for the Iraq war and it was a mistake. As soon as Bush went ahead and did it, she went against it immediately. So did the country. 

2) Because someone is rich they are immediately awful? Sanders may not be rich but I'm not looking and deciding my president based on how much money he makes, I care about what policies they are going to propose. 

I completely disagree. Incremental change is necessary because most of the time its a bipartisan effort to push out proposals and bills. Sanders is not capable of doing that, since Sanders doesn't seem to show that he wants to take a middle ground. 

Clinton on the other hand has a proven track record of working with people across the aisles, aka The Republicans. To me that is what also is her bigger advantage.

Also I find it funny that you don't want a ""small change wet napkin approach"" when you openly admitted that is going to happen anyways. That's how government works. Obama and Sanders told you all sorts of pie in the sky ideas and Clinton attacked both of them in her 08 and 16 campaigns saying that she wants to be realistic. 

Do you want your politicians to give you an actual plan or do you want your politician to give an idealistic plan that never happens due to the fact thats not how governing works? People get disappointed then. People are disappointed by Obama because he offered them that ideal and fail to give. Yeah its great to campaign with idealistic proposals, but after that president's term people who aren't affected much are disheartened DESPITE things getting better because of high expectations. 

Obama's ""legacy of small incremental change"" was based on the fact the found out that is how THINGS work. Sanders is going to do the same shit. Obama came in with the same pie in the sky ideals as Sanders. ACA was gutted into being what it is now because thats how things work in the government. 

Now the issue isn't that proper universal healthcare and free college is impossible in the US, because it is possible, but its because there are Republicans who will obstruct these proposals and/or gut them to the point they aren't what the constituents nor the president wants.

Obamacare's entire plan is to be an healthcare plan that evolves into what everyone wants which is proper universal healthcare. Hillary would've kept the ball rolling to that direction. Sanders would've dismantled it and start from scratch, only to realize his healthcare plan wont go through congress in one piece and then we have the same issue again. 

On top of all that, I love how you brought up universal healthcare as if Sanders is the only one to come up with that idea. Hillary Clinton herself fought for it during her time as First Lady in the 1990s and it didn't get through Congress, which made her realize how things work. In 08, she wanted an Obamacare like plan because she knew that's how things work, then she and her following presidents can build it up to being universal healthcare. 

So in the end, just because incremental change doesn't look appealing to you, it is how shit works in government. Sanders wouldn't have been able to do his major changes, and had to have broken down his plans. And while you do admit this, you seem to also think that Clinton doesn't know this at all. 

Lastly I still feel Clinton was the better candidate. And look by the end of the primaries, the voters picked Clinton and that's how it works. You can pretend that the establishment favored Clinton this time but this is how things always worked. In 08 we got Obama over Clinton because everyone jumped on the Obama train leaving Clinton to dust. The same thing happened this time, except Sanders was the victim. Also I don't find it surprising that the DNC and the democrats preferred an actual Democrat and not someone who became a Democrat to run, even though I personally don't mind. Personally I agree with you it sucks, unless you were talking about them rigging the actual primaries such as changing votes or something like that then no.

I also believe she would've been good for the economy, I personally believe Clinton cares about her legacy and address the economic issues in order to have one. Her husband and Obama did it. She also cares about this country, and her history shows it. 

She lost due to numerous factors, but before Comey's letter (the tipping point whether you believe it or not) she was doing fine. She was at a commanding lead despite her flaws, but the letter truly fucked over any momentum she was getting. She made mistakes herself, but to be honest I feel if the letter never happened and then she won we wouldn't have been talking about it at all. 

She wasn't perfect. She definitely wasn't the strongest candidate but we have to at least agree that this wasn't about whether she was the strongest candidate, but a good president. Honestly, she would've been an amazing president even if she isn't a great campaigner (she admitted she isn't as charismatic as Bill and Barack). Also she's very guarded, which I can't blame her since the media gave her so much shit about how she acts since she was First Lady of Arkansas. I personally like her and her personality. 

Every 8 years people want change and they switch from democrat to republican and then back to democrat. I'm pretty sure Trump's downfall is going to be that he made outrageous proposals that caught everyone's attention and he fails to put them to action. I don't think he'll do well in 2020 no matter who he is against. 

Apologies for the long post, but I had a lot to say."

What little laughable Puritanical world do you live in?

I've been married twice - am currently on the second marriage, actually. It's going quite nicely.

However, I had sex with the women I married multiple times before we tied the knot. A fuckload of times, you might say. 

I also made out with, stroked, fingered, and fucked other women.

Guess what? I don't have an STD, neither do they. And *GASP!* my current wife fucked dudes before me. 

Monogamy once married? Yeah, that I can back.

Everyone has their POV and it's critical that everyone understands each other. And identity issues should never take away from how you live your life. Things like white privilege get mentioned and it's not meant to invalidate their success or deny they experience hardships. It sometimes feels like that's the narrative being pushed. Some people falsely push it, but what you said:
&gt;I'm white. I get scared when I get pulled over because I know if I say something wrong shit could escalate. I admit the feeling would be magnified if I were black, but it doesn't simply not exist because I'm white.

His life's work has been to build up this brand. The only thing I can think he could possibly do is give it over to his family - as Trumps they are less likely to hurt the Trump brand. This obviously does not really prevent the potential conflicts of interests so all we can do at this point is watch him closely and make sure he continues to act in the interests of the public and not himself. Can you provide specific primary sources and not just hearsay of what you believe he is doing in interests of his business over the interests of the public? The media has been trying to destroy Trump's reputation since he first announced. If he continues to be a populist and do whatever he can to make the public happy he will be remember as one of the best presidents of all time. Thats all he wants. He just wants to be remembered as a great president. He doesn't need anymore money. He has more money then he can spend in multiple lifetimes. But I assure you he does not want to be remembered as a shitty President, or worse, as a greedy demagogue. When you find credible primary sources of wrongdoings then you should call him out on it.

505525,0,"You may be mistaking me for someone who believes in prohibition and doesn't believe mass incarceration is a huge problem.

There are all kinds of good reasons to eliminate the prohibition, including the fact that it produces crime and violence associated with the drug trade, the fact that it has led to the evisceration of the 4th Amendment, the fact that African Americans are much more likely to be subject to interactions (and arrest) with the police than whites, the fact that it needlessly burdens people with criminal records that impair their ability to get jobs, housing, social assistance, the fact that it's unnecessary and dumb, the fact that it's a plant, and the fact that there's little evidence it produces the kind of harm we generally reserve for criminalizing acts. I absolutely agree that it's not something anyone should be going to jail for (to say nothing of prison).

But it does a disservice to those fighting mass incarceration to say that people guilty of simple possession of pot are a significant percentage of the prison population. 

We get this issue raised time and again when people ask, for instance, why Obama hasn't used his pardon powers to free tens of thousands of people from prison for non-violent drug use. The reality is that the problem of mass incarceration won't be dented (to say nothing of significantly reduced) by making possession of pot legal.

First off, I was quite clear in limiting my caveat to SIMPLE possession, as opposed to trafficking. Legalizing pot possession likely won't stop the prohibition on trafficking. Whenever this issue comes up people cite - as you have - horror stories about people serving crushing prison sentences, but when you dig further you realize that these aren't personal drug users. That doesn't mean these aren't terrible problems worth addressing, but that makes my broader point: they won't be helped by legalizing pot possession.

There are two problems with the so-called easy solutions to mass incarceration. The first is that it mostly occurs at the state, not federal level. So even federal action on a much broader scale than legalizing marijuana possession won't significantly reduce it (and the corollary to this is that even federal action on pot won't change much since most of the prosecutions for pot take place at the state level). The second problem is that the really sympathetic cases - non-violent drug offenders - aren't the biggest component of the mass incarceration problem. The US generally has overly punitive sentences for basically everything, in comparison with the rest of the Western world, and if you want to reduce mass incarceration, you have to start there. That means reduced sentences even for less sympathetic people - including violent offenders.

The mass incarceration problem is complex - the solutions aren't easy, and they don't always involved sympathetic offenders. And the 420 crowd who thinks letting people smoke up freely in their homes is going to end it is facile and does a disservice to those of us who really care about the problem."

79476,0,"Alright, so what have here is apparently hacker groups based in Russia are allegedly linked to a DNC hack. Meaning they hacked the DNC at some point. The DNC has probably been hacked plenty. I don't know if that means we can say the Russian government caused the leak. Russia probably has done a lot of hacking of the US. I don't doubt that at all. It's the question of whether they are the ones responsible for the leak. Because I'm sure they aren't the only ones spying on us, and there are other signs pointing to an insider leak. 

I don't know enough to be able to poke all the holes in your barrage of links that I wish I could. But a few things stand out.

From your general overview:

&gt;a group of hackers had, in late April, gained access to the systems of the committee’s opposition-research team, from which the group had stolen two files containing information on Donald J. Trump

And yet nobody decided to release this? This would be the nail in the coffin would it not? ""The people who had dirt on Hillary had dirt on Trump too! Look here it is."" But no, nothing came of that.

&gt;more likely that Guccifer 2.0 is Russian rather than Romanian.

Guccifer 2.0 could be a Russian, wouldn't necessarily mean he was working on behalf of the Russian government. And again, has he really been linked to the DNC leaks? I thought we were arguing it was the Cozy Bear or whoever? What exactly is the link between Guccifer 2.0 and the Bears? Do we know he even exists?

I don't know, I'm seeing a lot of evidence for the fact that ""Some Russians are hackers"" not evidence that ""The source of the DNC leaks was Russian hackers"".

&gt;I'm not the one claiming anything about Russia's intentions behind the hacks

I realize that. I was just saying, if you're going to claim Russia was the source of the leak, it seems strange to stop short of assigning them a motive. Because, if you don't assign motive, you really have no reason to believe they would have been the source for the leak, over all other possible sources."

That's what would happen."
11727,0,"&gt;&gt; rewarded with tax breaks

&gt;Do the math. 1,100 jobs create how much tax revenue? More or less than $700,000? How much is saved keeping ____ out of 1,100 off the unemployment rolls...etc. 

How much did we guarantee in lucrative non compete government contracts? Carrier has billion dollar contracts with government. They will make millions upon millions off tax payer money and won't even compete with their bids. And we gave even more contracts to a company who now has over half it's employees based in Mexico. Those contracts should go to American made products.  You also are assuming none of the 1100 people would find employeement elsewhere. Which is false. We also let 1200 jobs still be moved to Mexico. 

&gt;Jobs are valuable, but there are intangible (and some tangible) benefits to having a community that works versus one that doesn't.

Jobs are valuable but at what cost should the American tax payers pay in order for a company who makes billions to not leverage those jobs for personal gain. We can't keep giving companies tax cuts and special contracts to bribe them to stay. It's bankrupting this Country and the jobs eventually are moving a few years later anyway. 

&gt;Do I like all the parts of the deal? Nope. Do I think it was worth it? Looks like it was well worth it.

No it really doesn't when you look at the revenue lost and the position we put ourselves in when other companies do the same shaddy shit. This deal shows weakness and the willingness to bend over backwards for companies we already pay handsomely and who make billions each year. 

&gt;Don't forget there are others involved too, suppliers, deliver folks, restaurants and hotels nearby, etc...

And all those would continue to do just fine without carrier in the state. 

&gt;Of course the left want to shit all over it because it may possible look good for trump, and that's their prerogative, as far as a 'reward,' looks like easy money. 

People are shitting on it because its a terrible deal and the man who made the deal promised he would punish the companies shipping jobs overseas. Not give them a reward for only shipping half of the jobs overseas.

I singled out WaPo because they initially reported it as ""Russians Hack Electricity Grid!"" and the facts are less sensational: during an audit, an internationally popular hacking tool created in Russia was found on a computer that was owned by Vermont's electricity utility, but the affected computer is not connected to the network that controls the electrical grid.  Those facts still add up to an interesting story worth reporting as they raise a lot of questions.  I called the story shitty journalism because they jump to conclusions that aren't supported by the facts, and because they don't seem to understand the technological angle - which is frankly their job to explain to the public.  Every journalist doesn't have to be a network security expert to report on hacking, but the basic concepts, such as the difference between malware and a network intrusion, are not that hard to grasp for the layman.

Anyway, it's worth calling out because more and more, establishment news outlets like WaPo, NYT, and others are either doing a bad job or purposely resorting to sensationalized clickbait headlines and stories in an effort to stay competitive.  Their claim to legitimacy is that they employ real journalists who check the facts and report them accurately, but if they fail to do this, they're not any better than Breitbart."

3935,1,"I'll stipulate that Trump is an asshole and Mnuchin shouldn't be treasury secretary.

That being said, headlines like this suck. The old woman didn't pay her bill in full. Twice. It sounds like she made an earnest mistake, but that leaves us with the question of how much we should let people underpay their bills and how long we should wait for them to correct it before starting foreclosure figures. How much of your bills do you *really* have to pay? How long can you drag things out before you see any consequences?

I'm not ragging on this old lady or excusing Mnuchin's behavior. The morally right solution was to call her and explain the situation until she got it and sent the payment, and if she never got it because she was too old or demented to handle her life, then the right solution was to put her in touch with someone who can help her manage her life better.

My point is that the world is in a shaky, uncertain place right now, and when you go around implying that people shouldn't have to follow the rules, you make the world seem even more uncertain and invite people to argue with you instead of agreeing that Mnuchin's a dirtbag and putting pressure on Trump not to choose him.

This is Reddit, the liberal info bubble where a Hillary win seemed virtually guaranteed. The same isolation that kept us from seeing reality until it was too late is now making us think that preaching to the choir with republican-shaming headlines like this will make a difference. It won't. We need to learn about the Republican/alt right world view in a way that's more nuanced and empathic than ""we're great and they're turds"", swallow our bile, and figure out some solutions that work reasonably well for everyone or we'll just spend all our time sitting around feeling angry and bewildered and discouraged while getting nothing done."

Each leak is a little bit worse than the previous. They keep escalating the situation. 

But this stuff is the little things. The evidence itself can't be leaked like this. It needs to go through a chain of custody. It needs to be able to stand up in court/congress. 

They can't leak the phone records and intercepts right now because they have to present them as evidence. 

They need Congress to act. They need the public to be outraged and demanding action.

Told that she could not vote unless she was a citizen, she asked for another application, and returned it with a check in the box affirming citizenship. That raised questions, and law-enforcement officials arrested her on fraud charges. White, an assistant attorney general who helped prosecute the Ortega case with Tarrant County officials, said the evidence of fraud was unambiguous. “She told the elections office she was a citizen,” he said. “She told everyone else she wasn’t,” including a recorded statement to prosecutors in which she said she was a citizen of Mexico."

An pediatrics advocacy group with 600 pediatricians as members is a ""hate group""? Just calling them a ""hate group"" doesn't rebut their arguments. It's not healthy to play along with the fantasies of children with acute mental illness. Allowing a male child to run around dressed up like a girl because he wants to be a girl is very deconstructive to the child's mental health on multiple levels. Wait for them to hit puberty, naturally have testosterone, and once they're 18 or older let them decide what they want to do with their body. Allowing a 5 year old to think he is a female is a form of abuse.
