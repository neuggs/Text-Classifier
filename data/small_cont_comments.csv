Are you that out of touch what your own party wants and what they have already implemented? lol

The ACA is an extremely socialist policy. They have subsidzed healthcare for the lower class. It is paid for by the tax payers. On top of that it is mandatory. It is a huge method of redistributing wealth from the higher earners and forcefully giving it to the lower earners. I am a licensed health insurance agent for 10 years now. ACA is an extremely socialist policy, look up the cost sharing reductions and the subsidies, educate yourself. On top of that they are forcefully making millennials pay artificially inflated premiums to pay for the aging society. That isn't fair either.

I guess ""free college"" isn't a socialist move either? Making tax payers pay for other people's education? That guy Bernie Sanders, he def isn't a socialist, he def wasn't the grassroots populist candidate for the DNC??? Debt forgiveness that Obama pushed, that's not a socialist policy either. The DNC wants to non stop tax and then spread it out how they like. I do not want bigger government, more regulation, more free stuff, more taxes and more redistribution of wealth for Americans."

All past presidents have spoken about the presidency as stepping into something much greater than yourself and taking on that massive role, and part of that role is to be the face of America. I voted against McCain, I voted against Romney, but I always felt they knew of the burden of presidency, and they knew how to carry themselves properly as president. 

That's just not Trump. His mind seems incapable of realizing he's a servant playing a greater role. His approach to the office is shaping up to be Donald first, presidency second.

The one thing that truly matters in America is not the flag, that's just a symbol that has changed over time. No rule of law derives from it, nor does any of our rights. It could change design, shape and color completely, and it would still just be a general symbol for America. 

The one thing that matters in this country is the Constitution and its amendments. everything important regarding the American system of governance and rights comes from that document. 

Consider this: the flag symbolizes what America is at the current time. If that America holds views you find abhorrent, whether they be slavery, abortion, Jim Crowe or over seas war, then the flag represents the America of that moment. Burning the flag then would be disapproval with the current state of America.

The Constitution on the other hand represents the American ideal, what actually makes our country great. Even if a person is burning a flag, so long as they believe in the Constitution and seek to uphold it, or change it through a lawful manner, then to me they are patriots because they know what's important. 

As for animosity to America, that depends. Do Liberals hold animosity to America when we engage in overseas wars? Absolutely, and they are called un-American for not supporting it. Happened in Vietnam, happened in Iraq and Afghanistan and will likely happen again. 

But do they hate America, and what it stands for? My guess is, if you ask the questions using examples from our Constitution, including the Amendments, you'd see a different picture entirely."

You can say the difference is cosmetic, but is it to the DNC or to Democrats who call themselves Democrats. I've examined this from a lot of sides, and as someone who is deciding to stay a Democrat myself because I understand that raging at a system as an outsider is less productive than trying to work with the system to change it... I see why outsiders might be trusted less than those who choose to join and participate within the system. 

&gt;He technically returned to being an independent in senate because he was voted in as an independent. 

Well, then it'd be nice if he ran as a Democrat next time, to work for change from within, I'd say. That's my opinion, and it's something I think most Democrats could appreciate. 

&gt;Imo he's doing a lot more for the DNC than anyone else right now by setting an example of where to go from here.

I think Sanders does a lot of good and has great ideas. I just wish he wouldn't cling to outsider status, personally. I can see the logic of reverting to an Independent to fulfill the will of Vermont voters, though."

 2. Anyone who is smart enough to realize that they'd look stupid or be embarrasses about saying they're going to vote for Trump is also likely smart enough to know that Trump is not qualified to be president. 

The only reason people are talking about this is because the polls are so close so Trump supporters are grasping at anything that can let them believe they will win.

Here's another perspective on the suppression of scientific data relating to climate change: National Defense. The U.S. Military has accepted as fact climate change. They have to because of it's impact on defense. How climate change will affect army and naval bases domestically and abroad, enemy bases, logistics, conflict zone and where new conflicts will rise, etc... There's a whole host of reason why it's important for the military to have accurate information of how the globe is changing. Whether or not the data leads to to the conclusion that climate change is a man made phenomenon is irrelevant to its future effects. If the military can't get reliable information from it's own government then the government is actively harming national security for the future."

Montana has 1 House seat per 989,415 people.


In other words, California is currently better represented in the House than Montana.



10 states are underrepresented and 40 states are over represented.

I looked because the truth matters to me.  If it's a good charity, I'll say so.  The proof is not there.

It's actually divine command theory. Absolute morality is merely a moral system that is unchanging in the face of any fact, especially subjective human facts.Regardless of context something is wrong. There's crossover with God but not necessarily so. 

Divine command (which is what a lot of people of Abrahamic faith lean on) states that whatever God declares as good is good and has had problems ever since Socrates and the whole ""Is the pious loved by the gods because it is pious, or is it pious because it is loved by the gods?"" which turns out to be a much bigger problem for that moral theory than it seems."

568109,0,"A post was voted to the top of the page. The top 10 or so comments in that post were all thought out rational discussions.  That is to say, the general consensus of the subreddit was agreeing with, or at the very least promoting, the discussion. The posts were clarifying, and correcting, an obvious spin on a statement. The post was deleted by the moderators. 

The same story pops up again. The top 10 or so posts are ridiculous, and extreme, spin on the Trump quotes; likening him to a dictator (whether or not that be the case...this particular story is in no way indicative to that). There is no discussion, as in the original post, of spin. Or at least no promoted (via upvotes) discussion. It is highly improbable that the same story, posted twice, could have such a colossal change in opinions. It seriously goes against common sense, and basic statistics, that not a single comment in the top 100 upvoted parent comments could be similar to the original (which was commented on more/upvoted more). 

This screams censorship. And censorship creeps me out. 

Add to this the fact that Clinton PAC has spent a million on ""correcting"" discussion on Reddit. And it seriously makes me question what/whether the moderators are being paid to direct discourse.  You may dismiss this as conspiracy...but not a single thing I have said is un-observable or false.

I've actually been thinking a lot about this in recent weeks. The alt-right and other hard-right ideologies have come under the spotlight recently, and what causes them - misogyny, xenophobia, poverty, disenfranchisement and so on - but some or all of those views can exist in moderates too.

I wonder of the generic root of extremism, on the left as well as the right, is a reductive desire to find a simple solution to what is, and always will be, a complex problem. It's easy to blame a group, be it a race, gender, religion or social class for societies problem and to think if we just eliminate that group then all the problems will go away.

634734,0,"Paul Ryan doesn't see a path to the white house.

1.  The House Republican Coalition is clumsy.  first had to find a way to jettison the Tea Party (39 member House Freedom Caucus), now it has to jettison the Alt-Right.  Until it narrows the ideological width to something that can pass legislation a Democratic President won't veto, it can only pass crisis stuff with Democratic votes (continuing resolutions, debt ceiling increases).  Then the Tea Party blasts them as RINOs.

2.  Without an ""anointed one"" primary favoring Ryan, he won't step into that arena.  It is bad enough that he has such a history of soundbites to hit him with, but if he has to repeat them all in a primary to fend off Ted Cruz, he won't be able to pivot.

3.  Democrats haven't forgotten the amazing redistricting victory that gerrymandered them the house (Democrats need about a +8% advantage nationally to have a chance to of taking the House, 54-46).  So they will come out with figurative guns blazing in 2020.

4.  Democrats are likely to take the Senate with a narrow margin, and change the rules to prevent a filibuster of SCOTUS nominations (not unreasonable given Senate Republicans whining about the people having a choice in who nominates, then start up saying they will block Clinton's nominations).  SCOTUS is also likely to weigh in on gerrymandering (in my view, we are nearing a Brown v. Board of Education moment but for gerrymandering).

School busing/integration was the final option federal judges had to make sure Brown v. Board of Education was honored.  Since states won't fix up minority schools then do equitable funding, they will mix the students up so that they have to fix messed up schools to not screw over white students.  Basically, the courts gave the states a ""use this opportunity to fix things yourself, or lose the opportunity and we will step in.""

In this case, I think the liberal justices are especially frustrated with the problem states (RBG's dissent predictions basically happened within 24 hours of the decision being released).

Past SCOTUS decisions relating to gerrymandering came in two main flavors and the third case that gutted the VRA:

1.  Ensuring minority voters aren't diluted into being marginalized (basically create some districts where minorities are the majority, but not only packed such that they are 100% of the constituency).

2.  Leave it to Congress to draft rules for other gerrymander cases.

3.  The VRA was gutted when a plaintiff challenged the pre-authorization requirement for problem states because the VRA as a whole was old.  So the majority decision basically said, ""We are invalidating the current list, but leave it to Congress to figure out which states are still problems.""  Congress has made zero effort to come up with a new way to figure out which states are a problem.

So my guess is they cite Congress not doing anything as a justification for SCOTUS to take over (""use it or lose it"")."

I think the democrats have went away from discussion of social freedoms in policy in exchange for overly exaggerated sound bites that most people can see through. Hillary is up on stage cackling about trump being mean to women because he called rosie fat and that is body shaming, instead of discussing detail plans about she would be more beneficial to women. Rosie odonell is fat.

 The Democratic party has resorted to using the ""fear the donald"" tactic, similar rhetoric to what you are condemning the republican platform for pushing. His is unfit, he will start wars, he hates all women, all Muslims, he is going split families and drop nukes everywhere.

""Any reductions we have in upper income taxes will be offset by less deductions so that there will be no absolute tax cut for the upper class.""  

Can someone clarify what exactly this means and help me make sense of this quote? From my understanding, deductions refer to a decrease in the taxable income amount, as do decreases in the tax rate (a tax cut), but deductions are primarily driven by expenses incurred to generate the taxable income. So why would lowering the tax rate mean less deductions? Wouldn't the expenses incurred to generate revenue remain the same, post tax cuts?

What were you thinking when you posted this? Did you think it would change anything? Did you think anyone not already on your side would accept your account of things and just move on? People are going to lean towards buying the argument made by top top ethics lawyers over the anonymous reddit poster throwing out insults. 

&gt;Eisen explained that ‚Äúthe founders did not want any foreign payments to the president.

This is what you are dealing with. You can't blame the 'corrupt MSM' for what the Constitution says. You can't win an argument by denying basic facts. He got away with that bullshit to an extent during televised debates, so maybe you're just copying him. That's not going to fly here.

And repeatedly you make the mistake of assuming attacking something is 'bullying'. I can write a letter to the city saying I'm discontent with the state of the roads, but that doesn't mean I'm bullying them. 

Actual bullying would mean Trump threatening to repeal laws/amendments to neuter or control the MSM."

I am an Immigrant who cannot vote- and if i see someone who did not use their right to Vote as a person who is MORE responsible for all this shit then someone who even voted for trump.

At least a trump voter was duped more enough to "" believe"" his bullshit- and even now continue to do so- there is 'some' conviction to that too

People who didn't-are the people who didn't care even a little bit.Americans should understand that their voting rights is a responsibility- to the entire world, not just america.

I see the left criticize Christians for their ideology all the time, why is criticizing Islamic ideology any different?

And before you tell me it's just something as proxy for discriminating against brown people, then why do many of the Trump supporters I know support accepting Coptic Christians or Syrian Christians or Arab Christians, etc. They are just as brown as the Muslims from those countries.

(1) a blood relationship between the person and the father is established by clear and convincing evidence,

(2) the father had the nationality of the United States at the time of the person‚Äôs birth,

(3) the father (unless deceased) has agreed in writing to provide financial support for the person until the person reaches the age of 18 years, and

(B) the father acknowledges paternity of the person in writing under oath, or

(C) the paternity of the person is established by adjudication of a competent court.

If any of these aren't met, her citizenship may not be established at birth, which would lead to the legal issues surrounding whether she is natural born. Primarily the hiccups may be (3) and (4)A-C

This isn't to say that the architects of such horrible acts don't know what they're doing, but overall society allowing these things to breed often comes down to fear, ignorance, etc.

Mistakes happen out of an ignorance for the result, and you avoid them by knowing that ""hey, doing X can mean Y happens"". When you ignore history and think you're somehow different than the people who made these mistakes in the past, you're basically counting down to when you inevitable repeat it.

Americans think we can't do the sort of atrocities the Nazis did because the reason what the Nazis did was bad is, drumroll, because they were Nazis. It wasn't the acts, it was the perpetrators (or perhaps who they did it to). Change the perpetrators to yourself, given your own biases and difficulty in self-evaluation/taking blame and responsibility as a human being, and then apply them to a group you don't like. Suddenly it's pretty easy to do whatever the hell you want to someone -you- think is worth less than you / think is less human than you. But you see it's okay... because you're right and your views are correct.

Except that's exactly what the Nazis also though, and any other group of people who have committed atrocities through history. We are always right in -our- actions and prejudices, and it takes an outside perspective / being removed from those prejudices through the flow of time to recognize how monstrous someone was in their choices and treatment of others.

The kicker for me is Trump's tag-line, ""Make American great again."" The irony of how his presence in the elections is simultaneously making a fool out of the entire political system AND the voter-base. The most shocking part is how close the race supposedly is... That means outside of the Reddit echo chamber, there are almost as many people that genuinely AGREE with what he's doing and saying. THAT doesn't make being an American great, it makes it shameful and embarrassing."
486548,0,"The whole point of the electors, not even the vote allocations but a small part of the college, was to preemptively check the eventuality that a snake oil peddlar would win the popular vote. 

The college is a system designed by the founding fathers because they understood that average people do not have the time, means, or interest to fully educate themselves on issues and are therefore pretty easy to sway against their own interest. This has happened numerous times in history; even the ancient greeks had checks against a pure democracy because they understood this problem. Its not a condescending interpretation either. It is just fact that politics is boring and people dont want to learn about the tax code, especially when they need to put food on the table. 

The fear of a tyranical majority is partially rooted in this danger. A 51% majority can oppress the remaining 49% *even if the majority is wrong*. 

So if Donny won the popular vote, while having preached dogma in direct contradiction with his voters best interest, with near absolute proof of illegal foreign backers and the likelihood for corruption, then he is the man the whole system is designed to stop. He is a man who speaks with a silver tongue, promising the impossible to people desperate or misguided enough to believe it and he should be denied the presidency because of it."

They are pretending that it's ok for a gay person to attack women because of course that gay person is just saying it like it is he doesn't have a dick in the game. Same with how he attacks Trans people, it's ok because he's in their ""group"". Nope it's still fucking shitty. His shtick throws off interviewers who aren't prepared as well (that's like everyone except maybe Colbert, TV interviewers need to do some fucking homework before they bring on a bullshit artist like this, Bill Maher wasn't ready, Larry Wilmore was).

The interviewer is immediately run over by his flamboyance which is just a vehicle for his speech. He talks fast and walks all over whoever he talks to. They don't have time to break what he is saying down and then allow it, which shows the audience its OK to say shit like milo does. He also interrupts anything to turn it to one of his ""issues"".
